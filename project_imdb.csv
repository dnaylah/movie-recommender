There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find adifferent path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.Who is your Andy Dufresne?One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving storyabout hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate witheveryonegiving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie,but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prisonguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of anelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor atleast one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a verysurprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. Ifyou have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'llwant to see this one more than once."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type ofmovies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to whatwill happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed,relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic stylemake the film memorable.  The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movieever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new everytime I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and(little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by peopleall over the world. This film has been called an American story howeverI have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and theyseem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I lovethe characters and all of the different personalities that theyrepresent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like theentire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. Thesounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part ofthe film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in whichit was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myselffeeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciatingthis film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We arefortunate to have him.'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time Iviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the mostastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as myall-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been lookingforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let'sstart from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe inAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become aresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to thefilm's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes thatlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first takewe are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantlyportrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is afeared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is arespected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellentactors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adoptedchild Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as heattempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have everbeen seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse'shead), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectivelywithin a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes tohave ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audiencewill refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple andaudacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife withbeautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-pacedaction and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatestcritical and commercial successes that gets everything right; agangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion andsubtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from FrancisFord Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have everbeen made."	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The film is divided into two main parts -the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and aworthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of thefamily. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of thefirst film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to thecinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. Theacting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscarnominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (FrankPentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazaleand Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance ofAl Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool,calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the originalmovie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida andHavana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece withthe greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.   The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every partof this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I wasvery surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfectsense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some ofthe most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the charactersare flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting isjust as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and foronce Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, andinterestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The directionis also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than hedid in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are somuch better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One ofthe best films ever, a must see. Flawless.Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives ofthe infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (AlPacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, ""TheGodfather"".  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully betweenMichael's struggle over the family business and the life of young VitoCorleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in hisrise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, andJohn Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's andNino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmedand the cinematography is superb.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor.Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest.And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast.Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate.Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...? It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame.If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks.As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea.Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz.Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral.

I made an effort to see it as it is rated asone of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watchedit with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be aboutold films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that Ihaven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressiveit is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about Americansociety of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. Thisfilm concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year oldPuerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However oneman, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a youngboy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of theother jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowlyrevealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience asthey react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars,prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this filmis how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors areshown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honesteveryman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the filmsmaster-stroke because as one by one they begin to question theirinitial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Ricanboy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that manyof the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s haveonly got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: oneof the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have norespect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. Howironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of havebeen born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing?Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of thecast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's ashame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part inmaking it one of the best films of all time. However within the castthere are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) andJohn Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such asPiglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please doso now.This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story isassimple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial,butone man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thoughtonthe matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors andaclosed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet howeverisa master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps youlockedon from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incrediblytalented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movieanddraw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. Amust see for everyone.Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males,struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seemscut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be assure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain ofevents that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is noteasy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, JackKlugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the otherindividuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than itappears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studiedand embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of5."	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But only once in along while does one come out and you say all those nice things, but one youwill also never forget. This movie is more than just something for us towatch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget,toteach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along withthosewho tried to help those same people survive. The first (and last) time I viewed this masterpiece in a theater, I couldnot help but notice the reaction of the audience upon their leaving. Somewere crying or trying to hold back tears, some were stunned, some hadcompletely blank faces, some showed signs of anger; but the overallatmosphere was one of utter silence. Never in the history of motionpictureshas a film had such an emotional impact upon its constituents.     This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. Itdepicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation,and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horribletimes and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tagline says ""Whoeversaves one life, saves the world entire"". And this film shows us that nohuman life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing morevaluable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life.Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed inblack-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photographyin modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and BenKingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, bringsthe whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This isSpielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task,but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. LiamNeeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of amodernday Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams'perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all theawardsbestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Reviewand the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg.Itdeserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film thateveryoneshould see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain animmortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Obviously times move on, and Iacknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortablescene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching itfor the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now hasto remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context-it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with achase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have writtenthose films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audiencewith intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movieincorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious.It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta andhighlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many filmsnow that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc butthis is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but neverwill.If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that.It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. Butwhy? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skullpieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point(unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't getit).Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action,gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of themovie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likesit by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lotof irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that hegave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't anotheraction heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are humanbeings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV seriesand a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others orselling drugs.What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing,the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest.In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. Amasterpiece.Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quiteappropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time,Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definitionof pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts everassembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, JohnTravolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken.The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I thinkthat's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the manyOscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film ofthe 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie(although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is thetop film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven'tseen it.Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories thatentertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. QuentinTarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fastplot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. Fromthe story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a datebetween a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lotof care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter theorder it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left suchas what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has aband-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movieredefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both JohnTravolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fanof film.My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It isboth a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original andunforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seemoutdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it beforethis film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because theyknew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film makingbecame the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominatedBest Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay anddirection by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman(both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who makeappearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, RosannaArquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course QuentinTarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L.Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time mayhave cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involveddeserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.

I have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck me as being among the worst films ever made.I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has disappointed me.The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the kingdom of Gondor.The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen, even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding. Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard Shore's memorable musical score.So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo Mortensen or Bernard Hill.Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed? Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

You've got men carrying revolvers that look likeold style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metalliccartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a riflethat hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of aColt,a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing ofmerit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in theSouthwest.Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. Ifirstsaw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entireWesternbefor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've beenthrough film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciatethem- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfightatthe O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, butsaddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy nevertakes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a blackhat,etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions.Blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a livingin a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we'retold, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making suretheCaptain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regrethe feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad,we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he alwayssees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, buthe's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself tolookupon him disfavorably.In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one ofthemost accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are noclear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just aswirled palette of various facets of the human condition.often overlooked or belittled by so-called ""film critics"", GBU is amonumental influential masterpiece. everything works: music, photography,acting, dialogue, directing, etc.the cinematography and music stand out as legendary film history.  who canforget the Morricone ""whistles"". or the harsh landscape united with a sweatydirty super close-up of an unknown Italian actor. there's just too much tosay about this landmark movie.  what a combo: THE ""spaghetti western"",directed by an Italian, starring american leads, shot in Spain, and takingplace in the barren American west. wow.remember, there's two kinds of peoplein this world, my friend, those who appreciate a masterpiece like GBU, andthose who don't know much 'bout great movies!!!!!!!! This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone foreverything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. ClintEastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by farone of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, crackingdialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around thebridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that justooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. Thiswas unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did itbrilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too manytimes to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo,someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.Rather than a review of a 30 year old movie,here is my recollection of a 30 year old movie.When was the first time you saw this movie?I remember the first time I saw this movie.Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 thingson TV to choose from, this movie or a baseballgame.  How do I remember a baseball game, it was thenight Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth'shomerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into thethe baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool.'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemedlike an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is MovieHistory. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25times.Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory.Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourselfin the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the peoplethatdefined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Uglyis nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back andexperience a classic."	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Takingthe ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginningof ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeitextreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream filmthat takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feedsit.The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cogin the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job andwhat he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave tohis IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to asmany self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessionsas he can. It provides him with an escape from hissleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (HelenaBonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters hislife and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets TylerDurden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whosestraightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizardoutfits are a breath of fresh air.One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tylerasks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurdrequest but after they pound on each other for a bit, astrange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind ofrelease and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. Ina world where people are desensitized to everythingaround them, the physical contact of fighting wakes themup and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in andpretty soon Fight Club becomes an undergroundsensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tylerhas more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls atthe local bar.David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turnsof ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date.""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains trueto its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message-- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame.What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only itsrefreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers saidmessage. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don'treally watch the film but rather download it. Its structure isextremely playful as it messes around with linear time to anincredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth allover the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- evenmaking a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in afunny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton'sdeadpanned narration holds everything together andallows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening.This is the way films should be made. Why must wealways have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club""openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favourof a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motionand every other film technique in the book that onlyreinforces its anarchistic message.A film like this would have never been greenlighted by amajor studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to theproject. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that hewas the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himselfdown and disappears completely into his role to afrighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutalfight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy messthat'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running forthe exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably hisbest -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character socompletely.If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is hisperfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It'sa deceptively understated performance as the last third ofthe film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearlyour surrogate, our introduction into this strange world andhis wry observations on our consumer-obsessed cultureare right on the money. They are the perfect setup forTyler's introduction and his view on the world which isclearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects thenotion that we are what we own.And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The filmis a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges thestatus quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed ina materialistic world where those who have the most stuff,""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all thatdown, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks andBlockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out oflife. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation throughself-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideasthat makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film thatentertains as well as enlightens.Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or contentthis bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption itbrings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directedby the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another filmwhich you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing onsad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is toown all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chancemeeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events whichconspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start afriendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from thatsmallacorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around whichthe whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground clubwhich draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night.Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, movesit up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This iswhere the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent,better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has somuch to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of youngmen (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolationweall feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us backtogether and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging ideaand it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would justsay'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of amaterialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself.You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band togetheragainst this uncaring society that has reared them to be something theirinstincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and onefilm you'll talk about and think about for days.Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presentsthe vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallowvalues,rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slickand ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein fromAmericanBeauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalkingexistence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is notgratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promotingviolence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, itissure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see withfriends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a secondviewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book.In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your ownconclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you'veseen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the stricturesof what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is thatthe editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of thefilm, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it shoulddefinitely be an Oscar contender.After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm.Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It'snot only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen itfor the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of theconclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in atotallydifferent perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrackperformed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind'bythe Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately FightClub didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got bestreviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of EdNorton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs thevillain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he isjust overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar."	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It also has eliminated some of the problems thatplagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper intocharacter development.  The performances are terrific, especially byHarrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian.George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequencewith the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  Theconclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker,is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entireseries.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminderthat just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean thatit has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedlyentertain viewers of all ages from start to finish. An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and mostserious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of theSith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, adiminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdownwith Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's oldgambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams.Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more oncomic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard withthe humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well.Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more thanthe original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it thatnone of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is atleast on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up inwhat is probably the greatest series of movies in the history ofcinema.While the Titanic made all the rich people (with the exception of MollyBrown and Rose) automatically uncaring, snobby, and thoughtless justbecausethey were rich and needed a couple of villains for the story, The EmpireStrikes Back did not portray ""the villain"" in a completely evil light.Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred andpastyhead.  When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling isallowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killingmachine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense oflove, however twisted it may be."	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Ithink it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Justrecently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and movingmeaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning ofit. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That aninnocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaningof the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook onlife. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not letthe big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw ustrials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have tojust bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That weall need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place thatfeels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone whohasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggestseeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects andprofound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Likeothers, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've neverheard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should readthe novel to get the author's intention (I remember some peoplepreferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awardsgave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should dowhat you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in theend, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not havingexpectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) Sohe ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of thetime. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brainsto think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of ourproblems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, whichironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. Welove our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in themoment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything ispredestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It issomething to mull over for a long time.I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that thebeauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocenceand purity with others, including the audience, he also manages toretain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. Asa Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I couldof course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gumpendures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blendingof music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was soperfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty fiveyears of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American historyonly became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the wellknown chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remarkthat stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.FORREST GUMP (1994)  Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, GarySinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comicdrama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentallychallenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won hissecond Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple,honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charmthrough his altering experiences that span the past two decadesflawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects byIndustrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous.Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when itfinally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}-watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love ofhis life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee)superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also anAcademy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle.Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. One of my all-time favorite flicks.

It's like themasses can no longer be trusted. In the last month, the users havedecreed ""Airbender"" the worst abomination ever, when in fact it's justan average movie. User reviews raved over ""Despicable Me"", when it wasabout as entertaining as a ""Dexter's Lab"" rerun. And now? ""Inception""is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a verycreative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. Theproblem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or adream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they'redreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooneror later you stop caring about the actual action because it's a dream.So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in thepouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up aski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name floataround a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rdgreatest movie ever? You must be dreaming.What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that inciteshysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out?Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are welooking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills!Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, thethrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception justmight be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it alsocontains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the mostresilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb.Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title.The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid toextract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into theirdreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, whenone client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporaterival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better.It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, apiece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverlyand intricately brings the audience through several planes of existencesimultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is thepower of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to getoverlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. Buteverything that makes this film so great is in the script...in theideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncannyresemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic thisyear, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks atraumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious towatch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm ofreality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than ShutterIsland and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be lessalienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. Thereis not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm andintelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance ispitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and JosephGordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes intoundeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawlessperformance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to beliving in the real world. The best part of Inception is the largeamount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does makeuse of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects whichare as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat thesedays. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy(femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautifulsuits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me whycinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch thisfilm on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud ofit. Not to be missed on the big screen!"	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

The books and the movies alike grasp one'sattention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sensethe pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is trulypowerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has somethingthe first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting twogreat islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily bedescribed. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. Thethird movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the actof coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passedthrough before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to thewritten trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstreamaudience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say theywere enjoyable and well made.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

No, not a great actor, a spectacularactor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it isfor several other actors in this film, who later have had long, greatcareers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif.The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget LouiseFletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or WillSampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The filmportrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mentalinstitutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperatelywanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and forthe others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. Inever took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about thisfilm for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very firstframes depicted the institution as something far more similar to aprison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making thatcontrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and atruly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives astellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, everysingle line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn'tchange a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never loseinterest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either.It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I evercome across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once,but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommendthis amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slightinterest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as theyare all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10It's tough to really judge this movie. Is it Milos Forman's greatest directorial masterpiece or Jack Nicholson's best performance. Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film. When a film is parodied as many times as this one has been, typically, greatness can be associated. Well, greatness was achieved, and let's hope this one never falls through the cracks.Jack Nicholson had been nominated four times, he had lost four times.  Eachtime he probably should have won, but he never did.  Just when you thoughtthere was no justice in the world, Jack finally came through with ""One FlewOver the Cuckoo's Nest"".  The film is exceptional in every sense imaginable. Nicholson stars as a prisoner who is sent to an insane asylum.  Whilethere, Nicholson creates an atmosphere which gives his fellow inmates asense of self-worth and a glimmer of happiness.  Throughout, it is nevermade clear whether Nicholson is truly insane or just acting crazy to get outof manual labor at the regular prison.  Whatever the case, Nicholson iscreating a place that head-nurse Louise Fletcher (Oscar-winning) is findingunsuitable for the other patients.  She is quietly evil and amazingly cruelto those within the asylum.  Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for ahead-on-collision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end ofthe movie.  Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif(Oscar-nominated) are all great in supporting turns as Nicholson's fellowinmates.  An excellent film.  5 stars out of 5.

Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"",""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likelynever been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-yearstretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklynwhose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at theheart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's callingcard.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino isquietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does thebest work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deservedOscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirtywork"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced manyfilm-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.    This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as arePesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he giveshere.The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fastpaced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy tomanas he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see allthehighs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and veryundesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable sceneswhilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the sametime.This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let youout of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted andexhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant tobeused, it was for this film.'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favouriteMartin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very bestmovies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting bythe large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography,editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. ButScorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their maingoal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. Asto the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been,and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have LorraineBracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces insmall but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas,Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who areall so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep aneye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but lookscool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one ofthe very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any moviefan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Everythingabout this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blendof stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, andunforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films evermade. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensionalcharacters which inhabit the film throughout. When watching the film, theaudiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every singleattribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many actionfilmsare made today; films like Predator and Alien still work within it'sboundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing isground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies,then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking ofKurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High &Low.Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well nearly 50 years later.Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters, mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his finest moments.The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave, righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless I'm mis-reading him wildly.I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the 21st century? The answer is a definite ""Yes!"". Seven Samurai shows us what cinema can be, what cinema is meant to be. It is moving picture as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope or beauty, but this is what every director should aspire to! The sad thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and marketing is the new godThis is one of those great epic films that stands the test of time. I onlysaw this film for the first time in 2000, almost 50 years after it was made,and was astounded by it. It was an epic that truly told the whole story.Whereas most movies today manage to skirt around huge chunks of what wouldhappen, this movie manages to show them all, and not in aboring way. The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until morethan 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to knoweach of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get totruly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart.By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of thesamurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way.The rest of the movie progresses as if it were a documentary, not afictional film, where we see each and every piece of the grand puzzle thathappens in this village. I can't recommend this film enough, though I mustthrow a disclaimer out that if you're not a fan of epic movies withsubtitles you may not be as interested. It is a 3 1/2 hour long movie! Butif you can find the time to sit down and watch it, I doubt you'll be verydisappointed."	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

For a generation of people it hasdefined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probablethat pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainmentsolution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basicemotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a betterexample of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. Whenyou think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening atthe time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.Keconomic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the armycollecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technicallyadvanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars leteverybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that wasuncertain but ultimately good.In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one ofthe greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasygetaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies youleft reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventureonce the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitementa kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recallthose times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eagerthirteen year old over and over again.I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  thisdecade and the next.Star Wars is a movie that has had great social impact, a fact that has oftengone unnoticed.  A harbinger of a changing mood within the United States,Star Wars was one of the few movies rated General that was released in 1977.Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (TaxiDriver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure.  While somemay decry the move back to swashbuckling from social comment, I for onecelebrate the fact that Star Wars made it possible for families to go tomovies together once again.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

It's rare a great film like this ismade,especially these days.I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can.I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors withdifferent points of view than the average American director. City ofGod is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classicstruggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directingstyle, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which manydifferent kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvardintellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycleof the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It evenforces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs inthe world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of mytime and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that.""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain.The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene.Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.10/10David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thrillerSeven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sortHitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) andscalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- theoverly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking youoff the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse inlogic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealedwithout ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps itsviewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascinationand abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter AndrewKevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiencesexperienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromisingvision.Se7En Se7en is just one of those movies that burrows deep under yourskin and festers. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew KevinWalker have created a bleak, desolate world where there are no realheroes, only sinners. An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visualsand terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic. Det. WilliamSommerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen the human spirit at its worstthroughout his 34 years of police service. He finally realises he hashad enough of the horrors of the world and he becomes ready forretirement. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a brash, hot-headed rookie copwho believes his big break lies in the murky, seedy unnamed metropolis.Amidst some cynicism, Sommerset takes on Mills as a partner for hislast days. When two murders occur within two days of each other the duorealize that a serial killer is murdering his victims in accordancewith the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envyand wrath. What follows is a terrifying and disturbing story of thedark side of human nature. Fincher's Noir York with endless rain, rainthat fails to wash (to quote Travis Bickle) the filth off the streets,is a harsh look into urban life where decency is a rarity. Along withhis cinematographer Darius Khondji, paints the screen with dark greys,blacks and yellow to hint at the rotting core of this environment.Freeman gives the film its most complex performance and moral core. Hisdetective has grown weary of apathy and he slightly suggests anunderstanding of the despicable killer. On that note, Kevin Spaceydelivers a chilling portrayal, a killer with a blankly human face anddisturbing conviction. Writer Walker has written a cop-genre film withimpeccable substance. Rather than a whodunit or an action movie, he hasgiven birth to a story that pokes and prods at our psychic. It forcesus to confront ourselves and question the next time we eat too much, ortake too much time gelling our hair or even lash out in road rage. Hequestions our day-by-day apathy and ignorance to the savagery of humanexistence in a time of war, poverty, cynicism and most importantly sin.A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer,""Se7en"" (along with ""Silence of the Lambs""), is something of amilestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actorsincluding the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow andKevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murdersrepresenting the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however thatlifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older worldwise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick,Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spaceydoes his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene withFreeman and Paltrow in a café which shows the depth of performanceshere. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world whereinit always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tightdirection and atmospheric photography."	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

""The Silence of theLambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sentto interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of thegreatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer(Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after theydie.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries tothrow a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctorof Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needlessto say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thrillerthat has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are theconfrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chessmatch of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever capturedfor the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself aroundyou and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements youhave seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5. This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and goreto have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the derangedgenius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was trueof Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go downin history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history ofcinema.The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning allfive of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement infilmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicatedparticipants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failedin the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Tautdirection and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film'spower, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performancesof Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share ahandful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting. With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horrorgenre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty andsuspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very wellthroughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames ofClarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The twolead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster isvery good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights upthe screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkinsdoes the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness andyet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  Hesays his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  Therest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as aunethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of theother killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in allaspects!"	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.""The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can'twatch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plansafter they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, theirmayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plansto eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in variousways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tightdirection keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  GabrielByrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite,and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is KevinSpacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work onall levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can becompared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5stars out of 5.   I have seen this movie many times and yet it still astonishes me every timeI watch it.  Even though I know the ending I still feel myself being caughtup in the plot.  It is possibly one of the greatest scripts of all time.  Ican't remember another movie in which I was completely astonished at thefinale.  The cast gives a tremendous performance.  Kevin Spacey gives one ofhis two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in myopinion.  That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role.  Itwas truly deserved.  Gabriel Byrne also gives a great performance.  It maybe the best character Stephen Baldwin has ever played.  In all, this is amust for any movie collector or enthusiast."	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Afterwatching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more todo with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father andhis son.  The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings andhighlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie.  Nosuch piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness inme before and that is the miracle of the movie.  The realism of the movieisnot its strong point, but then again it is  not supposed to be; this helpsin bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing onthe feelings generated by forgetting about all external events anddevelopments of the war.  Despite that, the movie does not fail to pointoutan element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who wasobsessed with riddles.  This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if eversuch an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state.  Life isreally beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovelyexciting experience of the concentration camp to his son.  You getexhaustedjust watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as hespeaks to his son and makes him laugh.  One can go on forever  describingthe creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all itsbeauty in writing.  This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie withsuch a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benignitotally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negativethings about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make thisfilm, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy anddrama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery,and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't missit!The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so,and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as thedoctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazingacting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves onceand for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversitywe can make the best of things. There is so much love in thecharacters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well asGuido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, buthey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people reviewthis movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was ofcourse a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it'sonly delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that aperson can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted bymankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too ""light"" arecynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what loveis capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. Thismovie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came awaywith this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that Ican overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone overthe age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is alittle over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy tounderstand. It's excellent!"	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

One is his understanding of pacing events, and the other is using his actors/actresses to actually act.When you see Claudia Cardinale riding up to the ranch, all you see is her face, but you can tell instantly what she is looking at and everything she's feeling. You know Henry Fonda's the bad guy, but when he smiles faintly at the young boy, you feel there's something more to him, a personality and human qualities, even if he is evil.The final shoot-out itself is a masterpiece. The two protagonists say nothing, but as they face off the music lets you know the moment as come. As they stand ready the scene that's been hinted at throughout the movie plays out like a dream, revealing what the whole story was about. Then, without warning, they draw and fire. Just as in real life, it's over before you notice it.What today's movies lack is how quickly they cater to MTV video inspired nonstop action and endless clichés. The bad and good guy duke it it out, the violence is so extreme that no human could actually survive it, and always just when you think the bad guy is dead he gets back up for one last shot. How much I wish today's film makers would learn Leone's lesson about TIMING, and let suspense build rather than force it in.The music score, which had certain pieces and sections for various moods and to signify the main characters, is one of my favorites. Even if Clint Eastwood wasn't in it, Charles Bronson fills the role of the mysterious stranger and adds his own elements to the character.How I wish they still made movies like thisThere are few movies that can combine great directing, acting ,music,cinematography, and writing into one movie, but this one does. Thereare no weak points. Every scene is a piece of art. I know of no otherfilm that affects the senses as this one. Henry Fonda said this was hisfavorite film and role. It's easy to see why. He created 1 of the great""bad guy"" roles in history. In a side note, Leone wanted to put browncontacts in Fonda's eyes,(""who ever saw a villain with blue eyes"",Leone said), but Fonda wouldn't have it, and the effect is magic in thefamous Leone close-ups. Bronson, Cardinale, and Robards are equallypowerful, all have great lines and the camera loves them. Speaking ofcameras, the visuals are stunning. There is nothing fancy about thismovie. Raw power is what you see and feel. Simply the best western ifnot film ever made.This is one true masterpiece, I can't remember any other movie (and Ihave seen a lot of movies) that is so powerful like this one. Thismovie has everything great ambient, scenes larger then life, hypnoticMorricone music and what is most important great acting. In this moveSergio Leone proved that he is one of the most unique directors inmovie history. If you saw this movie you know that almost every sceneis great piece of art in almost every scene you are amazed by visualstyle of Leone. In all other great movies (like: Godfather, Casablanca,Citizen Cane, Notorious,Big Sleep, The Third Man, etc.), you won't findthese many great scenes like in this one.

Iknew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it doesnot come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...andthe realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt alwaystheway things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through thisjourney, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to avengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, andyou feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasntquite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quiteshocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the waypeopleview others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me noton the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live withracism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if weeducate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around formuch longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace andLove, JB33  Rating 5 starsI honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American HistoryX in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I aman avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is justunbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. Hisperformance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his characterthat he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. Thelook on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen ispurely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful.It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life,and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events thatcreate a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I havelong awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act asDerek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such asmyself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremelycaptivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than ifEdward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear,which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, thelittle kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I wasstunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and Idon't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good asthis one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance forviolent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to whydirector Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to ratethis movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I wouldgive it an A+ with all of my heart.Powerful portrayal of Neo-Nazi movement in America. Told in series offlashbacks. Flawless acting by Edward Norton. Does its best to make thepoint that no one is ever right aand no one is ever wrong. I have a friendwho was a Nazi and a racist. But upon walking out of the theater after thismovie he hung his head in shame. This is why the film industrybegan.I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my Englishteacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished Iwouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybeit's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit moretraumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makesyou frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! EdwardNorton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head andeven more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid hewas and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also doesan amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't evendescribe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think EdwardNorton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he wasabsolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... Thismovie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking thatsome place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes myheart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see atleast once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worthit!This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on inlife, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I alsoagree with the point in the movie that proves that people can changefor the better and straighten things out in their head to do the rightthings in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for thegood, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with someof it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way""and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talksabout all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefsare right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but alsotruthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present.This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed tothe dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind andyour mind will come out full.When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I satthere as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. Thismovie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism,reallymade me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The waythat Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyeddue to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who haveany racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lotmore than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayalofexactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nationsimply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, foralmost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his ownimage."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, rightthere, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. Iwouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due toitsgraphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is overthe age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more peoplewill get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it caneasily tear apart a family."	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

A film that explores thepsychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves aroundhis family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking filmthat boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolanbrothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like'2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique inits own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, itcan't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful ChristopherNolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be namedthe best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest sciencefiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat ofcinema.'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, wereall amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seenin a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are alittle too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were someparts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thingis, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about.We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it wouldbe like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it'sfair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no ideawhat WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellentwriting from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and willno doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent,though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's scorewas amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all,'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think isNolan's most beautiful film to date.Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can readon, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like hisearlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a moviecan be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some sceneswere as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatreexpecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not foraction fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaugheydoes what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to allthe Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!!Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception,this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people whosaid Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months ratingit 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me).Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you lovedDonnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get readyto get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!This was one turkey of a SCI FI. This is my report.Near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dust-bowl corn fields of any mid-western alternate reality. The dad is played by Mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like SEVENTY through the corn without the slightest bump, all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone. After stealing the drone, Mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that NASA really did go to the Moon. He is chosen by Alfred to blast off with Catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3-stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space station/rocket-ship. After leaving Earth, they need no longer adhere to primitive Earth technology. Now they can do anything that already ever happened on Star Trek, including Cryo-Sleep.When they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that Stanley and Alfred told them about. They are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to, at least that's Plan A. There is a Plan B but it's sub PC and is not going to work for Mud who is all about hurrying on up back to Earth so he can save everyone.Gotta say more here about Mud's robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging HVAC ducts that can navigate through zero gravity, run across boulder fields, and even walk on water, not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying. After they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply. Each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on Earth. Where's Einstein when you need him? The whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since Catwoman can't swim.Back on Earth, the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their old-school monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dust-bowl Arkansas. Mud's kids get growed up and environmentally challenged, but it's really about how Mud abandoned them. Eventually Mud and Catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dust-bowl earth, yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there, perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers. They find a sinister guy who looks like Matt Damon's dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up. Mud decides that he's gonna take the tin man and fly into the near-bye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away. Mudbot knows in his crazy-brilliant, hillbilly-sage way, that if he just makes a B-line through the B-hole he is going to pop the cherry. With Hans Zimmer in the house Mud trips his way through the five-dimensional space. After an abbreviated acid trip (Thanks Kubrick, thanks Trumbull) Mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library. He peers through the stacks at his past-life capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who can't even hear him. If only he could communicate using just his sheer acting....Meanwhile, Mud's grown-up daughter on Earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to Argo F himself for not joining her in her cave. She doesn't like the air quality either so she torches her bro's corn crop. Harsh. Then she starts moping around in the old family library, the very same one that Mud is trapped behind the stacks in, except Muds library is made by humans from the future. At least that's what the robot said. Suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need is . wait for it. Gravity!Lots of good opportunities to cry here, what with Mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left. Something (no idea what) clicks and Mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the 'quantum data' into Morse code so that he can power-emote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on. Wait, did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? It did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravity-signal wiggles coming through the black-hole bookshelf world from her crazy hick-savant dad.Well that about wraps it up. Needless to say,... big daughter trans-codes the Quantum Jiggles into FORTRAN code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to Hawaii again. Years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryo-naps in the hope of seeing Mud again. Darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples don't figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find Mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved. Apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to Saturn with her tube and her hospital Bed. A bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed. When Mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at Mud even though he is their great gran-pappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love.More sweet, sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate. After an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth, steal a spaceship, and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robot."	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

So when Psycho hit screens, the audiencewas finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a hugebang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho createdwhat the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster moviesand changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and hisextremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinkinginto the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met herbloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone thatthis movie is different, different from every other movie you have everseen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelouslyfreaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everythingelse about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake wascomplete trash.Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into atight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinarycomplicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into aclassic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the momentbefore the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation thatverges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have becomeiconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have notdiminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined byHerrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive.That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it orre-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version -so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous filmaccident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectlythat even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard ofthe film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite thefilm. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's longexplanation. You can't. I couldn't.

I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but wasconcerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated onscreen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, whodid such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to thescreen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  Thestory is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not importantto the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectlysuited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like tosingle out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is righton the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discoveredin the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics arecomplaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film neverdrags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  Thelength is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the storyis so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so muchemotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes.""The Green Mile"" will haunt you.  Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the book, which in itself is a great read.I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way detract from either work.As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the book.I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had written it.I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4 stars. Great story, great cast, great look.Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyoneinterested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience.Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this moviewith someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and Ispenttwo hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This wastruly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one ofthe best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would havelikedto see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. Thediscussions following this film were wonderful.Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours canbedeath to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch oncethroughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performanceof his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actorthatbettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant likecharacter into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast cametogether and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a longtime. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who ismore known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully notlong till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it outnow,forget about the running time and connections to 'The ShawshankRedemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle.4 out of 5The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazingdegree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The storyitself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and theirportrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a StevenKing novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're proneto tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I wasin was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/dramathe film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upsetsome, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my videocollection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I've not seen afilm showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes areabsurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. Thedirecting is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehowtruthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy's firsttime in a leading role, for a major production, but he reallydelivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotionswas just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as heusually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriouslyhoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see itagain! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing aremake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsiderremaking the ""Joconde"" or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards?Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no needfor remakes...Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors,particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography ofimages are great, supported by good choice of locations supportingactors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a greatsolid base to the story.

Charlie Chaplin isat his all-time best as the Tramp, and he has wonderful chemistry withPaulette Goddard's Gamin.  Together, they provide an hour and a half ofnon-stop laughs.  My favorite parts are when he is fed by a ""modern""machinethat goes awry, and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory.  Thesituations and expressions are hilarious!  Please see this movie soon...youdefinitely will not regret it.Favorite Chaplin film. Packed with social commentary that is stillrelevant today. Chaplin does a superb job of representing the averageworker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of whatwe consider normal in society. Such as the opening of the movie inwhich a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into aherd of sheep. Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present inthis film while still keeping serious undertones. The best example ofthis is the eating machine. This particular scene was a perfectrepresentation of the problems in our society (a machine meant tofurther regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process)while also causing a laugh out loud reaction. My favorite part of thisfilm is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances.What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was thefirst time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stanceagainst ""talkies"". Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are completegibberish but the audience understands regardless. All in all I believeModern Times is Chaplin's greatest film, this was the first Chaplinfilm I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and founda great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warranttheir own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of NewYork City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of airconditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhatstormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminousGrace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spinersaid while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of thefilm is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! Infact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it showsthese two very different people gradually learning to compromise andwork together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have ahappy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality --refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including WendellCorey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRYMASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restoredspecial edition RW DVD was put together just in time to includeGeorgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving castmembers. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes,is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise asanything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, thestatic, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Consideredin this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with theaudience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personalemotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work.The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuckindoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. Hissocialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewarthas his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a differentsocial class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing withhis camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is,to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as heviews them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudestoward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexualinterest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he isreally looking at different aspects of either himself or hisrelationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul.These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his(and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses ofpotential past, present and future selves; and it is not always aflattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; MissTorso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there isa childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote overa pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with noapparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn'ttrying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then thereare the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is atfirst only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappearsand her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels thatlook like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is,understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss,but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees thatsomething is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome becomeamateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, aromance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors allgive superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making moviesfor three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knewexactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time,with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed andphotographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almostto change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M ForMurder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is afar cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before.There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independentdirector was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color.Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people andthings around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, nevershowing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learnedbooks and articles have been written about this picture, some of themquite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profoundfilm, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it canbe scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people.

It surpasses theoriginal in almost every way except the first film had a darker moodieratmosphere. But Terminator 2 has much much more, more character development,better acting strong direction, and THE most amazing visual effects ever!!!Cameron's and Schwarzenegger's best movie. A true classic.The Best!!!I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,butT2certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in myopinion,of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in termsofgreatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger isthegood guy once again,but you don't mind once you witnesstheincredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film isnothingshort of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forgetthetalents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave greatsupporting efforts.Thumbs up!	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

My father grew up in Boston and when wewalked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authenticthe environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which thelead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunninglyentertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one'sperspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg,Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'TheBig Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited butthey make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scenethey are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off withthe basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll findyourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting backand forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsesefan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearlysee the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of coursethe music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""ComfortablyNumb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yetthis one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agreeScorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscarworthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am Iseeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned withthe politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I hadsat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertainingstorytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a specialscreening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston isnot really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side ofthe city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors puton the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather thansupportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they wereable to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of thetime. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He hasreally come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored anumber of original performances all of which have expanded his range.He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and createdsomething that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One ofmy favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had foreach other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in anyother city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or notreally) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls andshoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail wasextensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raisedoutside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point,would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese'sdirection, I think he scored big with this one. While many havecriticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe thathe has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, myfavorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his thingsin his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it hisbest effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has createdsomething truly special from a city that is highly underrated."	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The filmblew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy Iwent. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donaldsfor $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well,and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixesscience fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of thescript is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has manyproblems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know abouttheir parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellentlycasted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one seethe many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with themovie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters.Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory thattime repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian addsto this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS forshowing all 3 films.BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985)  Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, LeaThompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popularand very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after successwith tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, asMarty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and issent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. EmmetBrown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parentsto be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he mustsee history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some trulyingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director BobZemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what itwould be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominatedsong ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels thisdynamo gem of a film.  Classic.""Back to the Future"" is a very smart film that benefits from likeablecharacters and an insightful screenplay.  Michael J. Fox accidently goesback to 1955 in a DeLorean that has been turned into a time machine by thewacky Christopher Lloyd.  Now Fox must bring his parents together after heinadvertently changes the future.  It is not quite as complicated as itsounds.  The film is great fun that seems brand new 15 years later.  A greatmovie by Robert Zemeckis.  4.5 out of 5 stars."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificentbuildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness thegreatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and militarydiscipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have aplace in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which allthe beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematographyare just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as itis present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps usvisit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all ourhistorical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such away that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel likescreaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out theperformances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors andactresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move theaudience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like RusselCrowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promisingharvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well,youshould see for yourself!I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the mostaccurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  Peopledeclare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus inquality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and thefighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D.RussellCrowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie.Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in moviehistory.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dreamcase.Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I haveever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant.RidleyScott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including themultitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depictingeveryday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empirewaslike, this is a perfect depiction.  	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, Ihonestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit.I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead characterdiscovered it.

Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Havingseen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected iton DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), Ican say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very specialplace in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's soconfusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war,forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itselffrom those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brandorepresents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They(Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, withoutadhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the onlyone who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death anddestruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate theindividual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you seeevery day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one ofthe best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intentof the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie wasreleased. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way toomuch to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden.Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entireproduction, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds theindividual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it,watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for allthe generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on thequality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with themindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole newappreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it orhate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-tellingstyle!"	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Christopher Nolan can do no wrong.Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit.What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets.And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas.The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist! I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all.At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other.P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's movies?I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years.Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollarsor so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted awayprecious hors of my life that could have been spent doing betterthings. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing thewhole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually canpredict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can seethe twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still leftwondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to ownthis on DVD."	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

This is a standout.The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it wasfunny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation andsongs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I stillcant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it,you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i lovedZazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba'sinnocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the bestfilm ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justiceto Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dadanyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant toteach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle OfLife"". I give this film a perfect 10.This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed itwhen I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched itover and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the bestsoundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can'ttell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"".Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motionpicture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The BestSong and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if theywill ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understandwho is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, thismovie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs byElton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cubSimba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason forhis father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on ajourney of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to hisrightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5.I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever becalled classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind,this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I haveto wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This filmdeals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the maincharacter, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny andlighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needsit. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of yourage. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever dowithout the help of Pixar.This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Everyanimated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreatethe masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a marketusually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animationstudios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. Anepic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments makethis film a family classic that will endure through the ages.10/10"	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This remains my favouritetagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it causedalmost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier.The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological,visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silencenot seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a biginfluence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequelsso far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed.It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for makingfear the best character in the film.The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD!'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatesthorror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most wellknown and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he'smade in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a nearmasterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scottmovies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is longpast his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work,and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything elseabout it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, anevocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects,including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazingmovie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors andnot ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will liveand who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done,'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an iconas Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtuallyunknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not muchelse. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed YaphetKotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') asthe wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer JamesCameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror andsuspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie,and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is ahorror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommendhighly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within thecontext of a broad comedy successfully.  Dr. Strangelove does exactlythat.Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy ofnuclearwar and the idiots who are orchestrating it.What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individualcharacterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens.To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With namessuch as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General JackD.Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will notbe soon forgotten.Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set,the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black andwhitecinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of""Strangelove.""  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatestAmerican director. Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? Imean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and BarryLyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able todirect such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had knownfor a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb,so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film.Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or hisfirst few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even thoughI thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his bestfilm. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was aterrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the filmtakes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film wasmade during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts onKubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make athriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized thata comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a betteridea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaustinto a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it.I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite awhile... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, infact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type ofway... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it iscompletely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logicand simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, andvery well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. Theplot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughoutthe film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not somethingcompletely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott andPeter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, buthere he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse andinteresting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's otherfilms, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(thebomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number oftimes... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick'sfilms, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written,well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't reallysay much more about the movie without ruining one or more of theinnumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously,if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his othermovies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did,but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan ofKubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a darkbasic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless youare offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. Iknow I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocativeplot and basic idea. 10/10Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie hedoes, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and bestdark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones(who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). Itturns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting byPeter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facialexpressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast ofcrazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these beingthe incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. Itcontains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption andpig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all inthose with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the openingcredits and end sequence with ""we'll meet again""."	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

I don't know if the black & white was aneconomic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been aseffective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of JoeGillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is oneof the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by theunforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMilleactually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim andyou have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films,although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy?Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama?

The movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strengthand is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever done.    I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface,satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could bemisconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to makinga joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his messagewouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use ofhumor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in.Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this filmdid. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attackthem, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the bestway to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for amoment that the war he was talking about happened more than half acentury ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time ofwar. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm,as it still has the same profound effect today.The Great Dictator is a beyond-excellent film.  Charlie Chaplin succeedsinbeing both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides astrong statement in his satire against fascism.  The anti-Nazi speech byChaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments.Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form ofintelligence,beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.Aside from giving this film its proper socio-historical credit as one of only2 U.S films which condemned Hitler, Naziism and the Holocaust prior to U.S.involvement in WWII, it's a great time as well.  Much of the humor remainsvisual, and some of the funniest (and most famous) scenes are done in thesilent mode (e.g. the globe).  Although a bit more lacking in continuity andediting than many of Chaplin's earlier films, to do it credit simply as apassable first effort at a new medium is to damn it with faint praise.  It'sunique.  No serious student of film can neglect to see and appreciate TheGreat Dictator as a classic amalgam of film talents.""The Great Dictator"" (United Artists, 1940), became the long awaitedtalking debut of silent film comedian, Charlie Chaplin (who also wroteand directed), in a political satire on Adolph Hitler, only the wayChaplin dared to do at the time. He plays a Jewish barber and Hynkel,dictator of Tomania. Some of the humor cannot really be absorbed atfirst glance, but after repeated viewing, it gets better. My personalclassic moment occurs with Chaplin in the barber shop working on abald-headed customer by giving him a shave while listening to aclassical composition on the radio, never missing a beat. Co-starringopposite Chaplin for the second and final time is Paulette Goddard asHannah. Goddard became the only Chaplin leading lady to ever make asuccess on her own while the others just drifted to ""B"" movies or fadedaway. Jack Oakie as Napaloni, the Dictator of Bacteria (a spoof onMussolini), appears late in the story but shares with Chaplin some ofits brilliant comedic moments. Both Chaplin and Oakie earned AcademyAward nominations for their performances (Chaplin for Best Actor/Oakiefor Best Supporting Actor), but no wins. Henry Daniell as Garbitsch andReginald Gardiner as Schultz also share the spotlight. Aside fromChaplin's screenplay in poking fun of its then current issues onEuropean invasion by the Nazis, ""The Great Dictator"" expertly blendssatire with dramatic overtones. Its closing scene in which Chaplinmakes a speech pleading for all people to follow the path of peace,brotherhood and democracy, is not to be missed. Whether this movie isabove or beyond the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"" (Paramount, 1933) isanyone's matter of taste.I agree that the final speech is powerful, and stirring. It made myheart hurt (in a good way ;-) But I also have to say that the comedy isfirst-rate. When the Charlie and the pilot are unknowingly upside downand chatting away...when the pilot is serenely reminiscing about hisgirlfriend back home even as the downed plane plows right into theground...when Hynkel delivers this vitriolic diatribe about 'the Juden'and the blandly impassive translator says, 'the Phooey has just madereference to the Jewish people' and 'the Phooey's heart is full of loveto all mankind,' ...when Hynkel strips his hapless henchman of all hisbeautiful medals, spitting and fussing a mile a minute...I could go onand on! I think no one else on earth could play Hynkel as hilariouslyas Chaplin, but it might be fun to imagine modern comedians trying. ;-)Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin forsaking his slapstickpast to tackle the serious subject of anti-Semitism, and intolerance ingeneral. He portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber- a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel.The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to thewhims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up itsresidents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day orweek. The barber is among them, but is befriended by his formercommanding officer, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keepthings quiet for a while, until Hynkel condemns him to a concentrationcamp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, most specificallythe barber, and the feisty young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). Thepremise will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put theirlives on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We needn'tguess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for thedictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by Schultz,also in full military gear. Hannah escapes with several of her ghettofriends to the country of Osterlich, where Mr Jaeckel's (MauriceMoscovich) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while.At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces,thinking him to be the notorious barber. The latter, meanwhile, hasbeen escorted with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing theconquest of Osterlich. The ensuing ten minutes is pure Chaplin himself,speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigratinggreed and hatred. Albeit Chaplin started production on the film in1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. He was allegedly unaware of thegravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the fullextent, he would never have made the film, because he most likelybelieved it would have trivialized the situation. He has a marveloussupporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, hisaide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as the bumblingHerring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator Napaloni, hisrival for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo'sfather), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographedwith globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminousinspiration, and luminous, as well, is Paulette Goddard at the film'send, smiling through her tears. I have seen this film before, but thereis always something new in it for me. Last evening, when it finished, Isat there in tears. I defy anyone not to be moved by it."	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good byeLenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself(a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not reallyto be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" thisimpression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killingdesperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall.This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of theformer East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director formaking this movie. 10 out of 10.Germany has produced some very good movies recently ... but this one isin a class of its own. The main power of a quality movie, for me, hasalways been two things, a good story and mood - and this film has both.The story keeps you interested through all 139 minutes. You actuallyfeel yourself transported to the 1980s of the former German republic.They have carefully chosen locations that looks east-germanish ... lotsof ""Trabant"" cars on the streets :-) and the general grayish mood isvery well recreated. The ordinary peoples fear of the Stasi isrealistically portrayed. And i just love the twist in the story in thelast 20 minutes or so. A brilliant movie that anyone even remotelyinterested in non-mainstream movies should see.This was my favorite film at Telluride. Everyone with whom I talked hadthe same feeling. It generated the most ""buzz."" I hope it has a wideaudience in the US. The acting by those who experienced the Stasi wasmoving and believable. Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi Officer was brilliant.Most of us cried during the final scene. Florian Henckel-Donnersmarck'sdirection with its twists and turns kept the audience glued to thescreen. Because of the film's popularity, it was scheduled again foranother showing at the festival. Both Muhe and Henckel-Donnersmarckwere present and were stopped where ever they went during the festival.I recommend this film and gave it a 10.This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born(Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wallcame down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few wordswere spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habitof speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. Icannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall comingdown. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmareyears of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal,convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have thepotential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thankyou Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of mylost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again thatthe difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice."	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

A realmasterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one,maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet itis so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: noHollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions andfeelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood andyouth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memoriesof the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare,some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings.Definitely to be seen.I have seen this film at least a dozen times and each time I am carried awayto a small village in Italy, where the dreams of a small boy come true andwe can join his spellbinding journey.  The Italian language (it issubtitled) adds to the film's beauty and music, the characters are so realyou can almost smell them.  I am absorbed into ""Paradiso"" each time I watchit, so that when it is over, I am shocked into the realisation that Ihaven't actually been anywhere except right there, in my theatre seat. I amnot a huge ""art house"" film fan or indeed enjoy subtitled films (it is hardon the old eyes!) but ""Paradiso"" is a gem and is worth seeing again andagain.Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals withidentifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on somany levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini'sstyle as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotionallevel. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life,language,(different from Italian) and how ""history"" has intruded uponand shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show thattraditional concepts of what is ""moral"" or right is not to be taken forgranted because of the people and their particular history. For thosewho do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educatethe ""outsider"" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to theWWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details thatpertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theaterback in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have severalscenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am verycurious about the uncut version and what is different about it.Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a lovestory and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still inlove with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down ""..tolove one person. . . "" as his mother says to him after his 30 yearabsence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows himlooking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This filmhas many little ""hints"" that serve to inform the viewer and give just alittle more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I haveever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we knowthem--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) iseverything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The lovebetween a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love forthe movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are afilmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favoritefilm (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for themovie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of yourquestions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life.The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into awhole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect.If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals willpush you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about.Terrific.I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film fromItaly,and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo,thesmall Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and theolder man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in aworldof make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from thesmallSicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredobecomesfor him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It isadeceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. Younever want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreakingsimplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio isamarvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. PhillipeNoiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow upwith Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns tothe small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the storyoflife, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It isunforgettable."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is thecomplete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, thesignificance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but initsbrilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly actedby Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemylurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify orcondemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darkerside of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabasheddepiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself;and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice othersfor their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favouritemovies."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Usually I'm not too crazyabout Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I'veseen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overallexperience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I wasa bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie(it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the verybeginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraidto miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies,nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5.Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more researchon it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend thisfilm!Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie.A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring westerndisguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne andSergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It'sdesigned to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surpriseyou. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violenceand the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if youlove to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're infor a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django(Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as adentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz)who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the BrittleBrothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation runby Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter onlyfor them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife,Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. Heeven has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearlyrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics),who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I thinkQuentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in thefilmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject hisstyle in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in hereas well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makesyou want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film ismagnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer RobertRichardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. Theperformances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"",Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us.Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body)playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rulesand limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born tobe a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performancefor ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor andvulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen anactor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio.As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runsa tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the deathand female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind ofguy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino'sdialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals threedimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literallyterrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L.Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great fromWalton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar,Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained""has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But atthe same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearrangedhistory by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up ata movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping aman who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. Thismovie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the mostcaptivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year.Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there arecharacters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that usesthe N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to thetime period, don't ya think?At first I didn't want to see this movie because of some politicalremarks made by Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson, two of my previouslyfavorite actors, but Quintin Tarentino is a great director, so I brokedown and saw it. Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best moviesof the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would nothave been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole everyscene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo wasgreat too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintinsmovies, but a great story. Also expect to hear the N word about 2000times. Cristoph Waltz should get the Oscar for his performance. Shouldget nominated for best picture. This is absolutely a must see.I rarely bother to give reviews after watching a movie. But holy crapthis was a good movie. I'm pretty sure it is the best movie i've seenall year. and yes i saw dark knight rises, avengers, flight, Argo,hobbit, etc... Tarantino delivers and then some.. Every actor is onpoint. Awesome performances, great story, it will definitely take youon a ride full of surprises. I would recommend everyone to go watchthis film, it is truly a great film.. unless you're a little kid..don't go watch this movie if you're a little kid. I've seen all ofTarantinos movies and I have to say this has been my favorite. It isjust awesome in every way. I'm usually very harsh on movies. I mean illwatch just about anything, but for me to think a movie was actually""good"", takes a whole lot. DiCaprio was like i've never seen himbefore, and being one of my favorite actors, it was a little weird atfirst. But he does an outstanding job at selling his role withinseconds of his first appearance. Waltz delivered as i knew he would.and Jaime Foxx, well he did not fall behind. Last but not least Jacksonwas hilarious and also did an amazing job... Go watch the movie, it isworth it."	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" wasenough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for anentire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is whatstill happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen TheShining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to besimultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yetfunniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarilyeffective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lensshots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tensionlevels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of JackNicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. Itneverceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both acomedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacingnature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolveintoever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may,there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, butthatis little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is moreimplied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that workssymbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings andthe way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weaknessof will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn yourownimagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece,the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highlyrecommended. - PaulEven though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challengeanyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness.This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been ableto rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in popculture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understandall the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneouslyscary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It hasthe classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

They just can't seemto make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, Iwill admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""leastfavorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. Thisone, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with theabsolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful --this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilersor specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitelygoing to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth everydime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie ofthis year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving &excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the bestsci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitelysucceeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the sametime. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score forWALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo inwhich I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar bestfilm so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which Ithought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is thebest Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind andFinding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitelyenjoy this one.

It makes me speechlessly. Good dialogs, beautifulsoundtrack,incredible animation effects (take a look at the rain, atthe movement of the grass, hear the sounds of the steps) andinteresting characters,who are everything but ordinary. Ashitaka iscaptivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (thePrincess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous-is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her?Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourageyou. Go ahead and watch Mononoke. It's a totally new way of treatingthe conflict between men and nature, which is far from its ending.Definitely, a jewel among the predictable animations of Disney andPixar's also predictable jokes. There are no jokes here. TAKE A LOOK ATIT!A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection ofmovies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I haveforced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at theentire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movieI do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty andclouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of agiven flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I firstthought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style andsee it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimedHayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (andthere are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I becameenthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently direfate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. AfterAshitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy hisaffliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I wason the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longerdisliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though notover-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the Englishoverdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy theaccomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersedthroughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerlyawaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict ofthe plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerfulmoral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about asmuch savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good,and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature andcivilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those whorated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All Ihave to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolicattributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing allthese features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate thefilm, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the worldbe like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?"	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...I rate Aliens a perfect 10.  This second installment in the Alien seriesevolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre intoaction-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched.I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which isrealistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and thenquickly introduces you tointeresting characters who you become concerned with; some you love andothers you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the actionstarts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the firstcouple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionallybroken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially byPrivate Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the factthat they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digitalmanipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate thisversion a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fansof the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense,action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!"	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I havejust read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. Ican see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered.This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally andpainstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I havewitnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the charactersbelievable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I wasleft with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after Ihad watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film.Do not miss it under any circumstances!I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspiredto with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film byaccident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouringthe internet to find out information about it and can't get it out ofmy head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lotfrom surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don'tbuy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should'vedone this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to beunrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on yourhead! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a fewtimes ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Pleasedon't ruin it by remaking it!!!)I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite franklyunwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and allfilms have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film hasis the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing andvisually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale ofthe comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in oneway or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can getyet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulgethe plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my selfimportance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not toosqueamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about itthe following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows mymemory is working!)"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Sadly, America didn't alwaysrepay the compliment.  Leone's were ""spaghetti westerns"", money makers tobesure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh andHathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwoodfilms cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By thetimethat they caught on to Leone's genuine popular appeal, the director hadalready moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned aspretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western,the Heaven's Gate of its day. That film's canny blend of pop appeal andpurecinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), andhelped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the earlyseventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made byLeone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that wouldencompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than dothePuzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, andfinallyrealized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or sobetween conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself,byRobert De Niro's (""Noodles'"") opium dream of the  American twentiethcentury, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, onceagain, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its denselymulti-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon itsrelease, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process.Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get aglimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few sawitproperly in theaters, but the video version respects the director'sintentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen televisionscreenaspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviatedhisusual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled lastprojectwas the first released on video to most properly  resemble the truecinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatientwith this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  Thiswill eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don't get theearlierLeones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantlysurprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. Itwilldeliver for decades of viewing to come.         Leone's beautiful vision met with an epic story to create one of themost beautiful movies of all time. Four hours long but time melts awayas you are transported into New York. In a movie where the importanceof time is stressed, and how it should not be wasted, it is pleasingthat this considerably long movie does not waste, rather enhance yourtime. Instead of regretting lost time we are instead left exhilaratedand wondering. Performances all-round are fantastic right from thechild performances, 'Noodles, I slipped' to the aged De Niro with alook in his eye that he has seen it all before. His weariness isastonishingly realistic and applause should be directed at De Niro andhis method. A true masterpiece.Once Upon a Time in America, which bookends Once Upon a Time in the Westas director Sergio Leone's best work, is a powerhouse of a movie. Agangsterepic told in a very different style than the standard of the genre, TheGodfather, it is in some ways (at least to this viewer) even moreemotionally compelling.Although the movie was sabotaged upon release by an edited studioversioneliminating about 40% of its original length, the version now availableforrental is thankfully the nearly 4 hour version intended by Leone.  Thestoryis at essence a basic one about friendship among thieves, telling thestoryof a group of Jewish kids in New York near the turn of the century whogrowup to become powerful and ruthless mobsters, while maintaining (or tryingto) their bond with one another.  As was most famously done in the taxiscene between Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, themovieagain makes the point that bad people can have good aspects to them, suchasloyalty, devotion, and even love.I think this movie includes one of Deniro's best roles, and far and awayJames Woods best film work. The score, by arguably the greatest moviecomposer of all time, Ennio Morricone, is incredibly haunting in itsbeautyand sadness (with no fewer than three separate themes that arebreathtakingly beautiful).  The non-chronological manner in which thestoryis told results in a wonderfully effective narrative device:  the moviebegins and ends with the same scene.  The first time you see the scene, itis a frantic jumble, without meaning or context, and you do not know whyitis so important.  When the scene recurs at the end of the film, everythinghas become clear, and the scene has an incredible poignancy and sadness toit:  although it occurs in the middle of events chronologically, yourealizethat, in a real sense, life stopped at this point for one of the film'smaincharacters.  There is no other event that matters anymore tohim.This is not a simple movie, and it merits repeated viewings.  Indeed, inmy view one cannot fully appreciate the greatness of the film until thesecond viewing, when the full story is known, and the  events of the filmresonate with knowledge of where they ultimately, and tragically,lead."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I must say, it's great. The plot is great, andthe way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matterof minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of thefilm has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling.We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart fromhis own. The story is told after his death, and we see everythingimportant that leads up to it, and only in the very end do weunderstand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and whatmade him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most importantthings in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knowsof. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil theexperience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welleshimself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along withhis commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay,experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The characterof Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I'veseen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editingis great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitionsenough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I cancriticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but itfeels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where itfelt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog orsomething equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There weretoo many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. Itdidn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is sominor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still givethis film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with itsplacing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. AsI'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in myopinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(thatpretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, Ihaven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far upthere. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone whothinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that anyman(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film forthemselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deteryou from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, inevery sense of the word. 10/10The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William RandolphHearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who wastheeditor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops acrystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shownabout the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquiredhis fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figureoutwhat the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before hedied.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life tryingtoget information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying`rosebud'as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed showthe audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the openingscenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says`notrespassing' that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very darkandgloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way.  He was a verypower-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Manyothermovies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  Thecamera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kaneoneof the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all thecredit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character,producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of usappreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so muchsymbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what wassymbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but mostofthe symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes thatalso foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is toldthat he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera isshooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane'slifeand career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all whotook part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemedveryreal and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film hasfeatures that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, greatactors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and soundtechniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in theirlife time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We love to watch every submarine movieevermade, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The HuntForRed October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use agood laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutelyhilarious.Except this one.After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 differentmen, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarinesailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this filmisthe ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously.And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possiblyget.""Das Boot"" is a classic. This film couldn't be more intense andemotionally draining. It is a work of genius. Jurgen Prochnaw gives aspectacular performance as the German U-Boat Captain. The acting isfirst rate as the cast of characters is as realistic and believable asit gets. Don't watch this film unless you are absolutely prepared toimmerse yourself into the drama of life as a crewman aboard a Germansubmarine during war. This is a very rare portrayal of battle throughthe eyes of our enemy and will actually have you cheering for the ""badguys"" at times. This is a one of a kind movie that must be seen to bebelieved. Words in a review cannot describe the experience of ""DasBoot."" A tremendous film! A 12 on a scale of 10!The first time I saw this film I could not take my eyes from it. I wasmesmerized with the transition of a hearty young crew leaving portevolving as the sheer moments of terror (deep under water battles andpersonal struggles as well as the final scene) lead them all to rethinktheir actual cause, and their very own mortality (as well as our own inthe perils of war!). I can't imagine another film actually displayingwhat it must have been like to be on one of Nazi Germany's U-boats -young nationalist boys being plucked from their mother's bosom and castinto the claustrophobic iron wolfs in the heat and height of the secondworld war, who begin to doubt the cause and victory of the fuhrerthey've been taught to love and trust. Very colorful, contrastingcharacters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotionaldrama/trauma. Top-notch direction, action, acting and sets. This isperhaps the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. Sorry I couldn't bemore specific with the review, there is just too much to cover withoutspoiling anything for those yet to enjoy it, and thus I just highlyrecommend it to anybody, not just war movie buffs. I have seen both theregular version and the director's cut (which I own on DVD now) and Imust say that the DC is superior. A masterpiece!Das Boot is one of the most emotionally involving movies I have ever seen.The characters are developed richly, without those awkward moments in movieswhen you realize that the director is doing so.  You sympathize with thecrew, and FEEL their plight as they struggle, cramped in a rickety U-boatagainst the odds.  At times the movie grows slow and drawn out, but that isintentional- to make you feel like you are trapped in an underwater coffinwith nothing to do, no where to go.  The directing is great, the sound isfabulous!  I've never heard faint noises tell a story like this before.War movies have been biases to one side or the other. This movie doesnot make hero's or enemies of the German U-boat sailors. Instead, itgrips the viewer with realistic depictions of what it was like to be aU-boat sailor for the Gemans in WWII. It starts off with young (17 yearold to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the wareffort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailorsstart to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, butexperience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work anddeath. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to beyour eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies,these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize thehorror of submarine warfare in WWII. The most realistic war movie Ihave ever seen.When you go to a liquor store to buy Vodka you can purchase one of severalbrands or you can purchase Stoli. That's what Das Boot is when it comes toSubmarine films. You can watch any one of several or you can watch DasBoot.Like Stoli Vodka it's in a class by itself. Superb film either way you seeit i.e. subtitles or the dubbed version. See the directors cut if you can.The German crew could be any nationality the film is so well done itdoesn'tmatter.Andy Rooney once said that when you're in a war you live life at 100%.Theopening scene of this film demonstrates that. The men are living life at100%. I never saw any other war movie that captured that like Das Boot."	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Its been called the most personal, emotional, and complexof Hitchcock's films. I agree with all of these things except for one,this film IS Hitchcock's masterpiece work. All of the others pale incomparison to this. There are phenomenal performances here by JimmyStewart who plays the biggest anti-hero of his career and Kim Novakwhose stunning beauty and exceptional personalities shine through thisdark film. Barbara Bel Geddes provides great support as well.Everything about this film, the cinematography, the story, the depth,etc. leaves you mystified and transfixed on this dizzying, surrealartwork of a film. It truly is flawless. If you are a Hitchcock fan andhaven't seen this you need to get up right now and buy, not rent, thisas soon as possible!I have seen ALOT of movies in my life, but none have moved me the wayVertigo has...It's simply brilliant...the more times one views it, themoreone picks up from it...a true masterpiece from the master himself...When Ithink Vertigo, I think the colors red and green...when I think Vertigo Ithink obsession with love, and the film itself...This movie is so deepthatyou could write a thesis on it and keep adding to it from time totime...Hitchcock really gave his all in this picture...it's about theultimate love...wanting to achieve the ultimate love, and, as happens inlife, never having love turn out to be the way we want it to be...all starperformances by Stewart, Novak and Bel Geddes make this visually stunningmasterpiece a true film classic...Newly restored, the DVD version simplyblows you out of the water....I have seen the movie about 20 times now,andeverytime I love it more...Vertigo is the ultimate cult film for me, as Ikeep going back to it more and more...considering it's dark storyline, itmust be a glut for punishment, but Hitch only keeps me wanting more....10stars...only because I can't give it 100 stars!I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock's greatest movies becausethey are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, somulti-levelled, that it's very difficult to put into words what makes themgreat. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo',though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowningachievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it inany way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I seesomething new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did theprevious viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star inHollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of thebest in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had alwaysbeen superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' afew years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and isjaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' isregarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it wasoriginally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of thishad to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficultsubject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession,something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost asgood as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role thatshe will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece fromHitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other filmmakers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it isthat it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you willnever forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest Americanmovies. Simply astonishing.Retired detective, who is scared of heights, is hired to follow another manswife and there follows intrigue, mystery and suspense. A super melodrama!The acting,directing, sets, costumes, script, music, etc are allexcellent.And near the start of the film there is one brilliant 10 minute period whenthere is no dialogue but the action is controlled only by themusic.A sensational analysis of the movie is by Roger Ebert: see externalreviews.This picture is worthy of maximum marks. 	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The first part of the film resolves thecliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that isin keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films.Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in thewar.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion'sfinal confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audienceis already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, andthis final battle is even more intense than those from the other films.This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of thetrilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continuallychanging between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land(including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space(including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on thenew Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It isreally intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle thatwill determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape.Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bitfar-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of adistraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to thestormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There isalso a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not bequite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete avery spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" andthe more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film reallycompletes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The SpecialEdition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been niceto change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen yearsof technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years ofdeterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still isthe occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good.The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and ahuge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to thesuspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lameending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanningthe entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the caseof the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way itdeserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but sinceit's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big,outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.This is the film that pretty much answers all the questions.  One thing thatI did notice is that it dealt with the theme of redemption.  Luke prettymuch wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regainshis humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy theEmperor, the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in thefilm where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, itstill has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a parwith the previous films."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The style and dialog of this picturebestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the realityof their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutelyriveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrificaspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of analmost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is inmeeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no morecrucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is theportrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in alife of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it onlyserves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  Thedirector has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not alinear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weavetogether a story that is not as important as the individual parts that youhave the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewingto truly appreciate.  I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the moviewas about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I sawpeople wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had neverseen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without everwatching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is aclassic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong andthe consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a greatcast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are greatbecause they stress the story more than anything else. In all of hismovies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add goodover the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie iswhat grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandonedwarehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie withoutwatching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino,""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as mostanyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit ofself-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice inpointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there'svery little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is;you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing...and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. Astylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music.The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creatinga sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told.The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever reallywant it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent,and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget,the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The actingis top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, thisis no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel,Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well,let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course,of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk TillDawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen himact, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-makermyself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I canrelate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you justneed to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still,that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at leasttwo fairly big characters that seem completely and entirelyexpendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, veryeasily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won'tname them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'mtalking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and theiractions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing...something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhatdrawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comesto direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is verywell put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-linetelling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One ofthe many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talkedme into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someoneediting films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc.- so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirelyrespect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that theirdoing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way...but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told liesin the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something theway the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make yourown version and pass it off as anything but just that... your ownversion, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just needto comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great.Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and usedthem great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very littlekeeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. Irecommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likestheir films with a side of style. 8/10"	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

People will complain, willargue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as closeto perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man whoplayed Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both shouldhave been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of eviland a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) bymeeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, thecinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slowmotion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, theentire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera.Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film isnumber 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes thereis violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...thatfreedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible,to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is agreat movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb'slist of greatest films.This is simply the best movie ever made, containing all the elements aperfect movie should, even considering that every person has a right tohis/her opinion.

This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction andover-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drugaddiction.Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it canbefor you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had tocall a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (onemoretime)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn andJennifferConnely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such ashocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainmentvalue, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chillsdown your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.Oh my, where shall I begin? Experimental film making bursts intomainstream in this dramatic tail of 4 people who find themselvesspiraling down the abyss, after experiencing a rendez-vous with theinevitable consequences attributed to drug use and the ill effect ithas on its addicts. This one has no happy ending. There's no sugarcoating here. Albeit this film packs a harsh, blunt, and sometimesoverwhelmingly genuine depiction of the havoc drug addiction can reapon its victims. Despite the disturbing message of the film, I never theless couldn't help but remain fascinated with it'sexperimental/avant-guard visual style: A smooth, elaborate and languidprogression of cinematic eye candy orchestrated to almost resemble ashockumentary, complemented by an impressive and well composedsoundtrack. Some of the visual techniques were similar to the onesAronofsky used in his directorial debut ""Pi"", such as split-screenshots and the use of body cameras filmed at varying speeds. At times,the film seemed more like an acid trip than a feature film. A cry forhelp is clearly felt throughout the film, from its innocent andpromising start, to its hauntingly chilling conclusion. The one scenethat really blew me away was the scene where Marion (played by JenniferConnelley) had just sold her body off for a bag of heroin...As shewalks out the door of the apartment, along the corridor, into theelevator, down to the street: one can't help but feel the charactersdisgust with herself, filthy to the core, what it must feel likeat...""ZERO"". The acting performances, especially by both Ellyn Burstynand Marlon Wayans are simply breakthrough performances that earnedcritical acclaim across the board. Enough said. If this review alonedoes not compel you to experience the Film, I will just have to spellit out: PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS FILM - it may cause an uneasy stomach,but is well worth it - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! 11 out of 10."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I don't remember crying like that before.Subject of the filmis not only Turkey's problem,all families' problem. Subject iswonderful,music is wonderful,actors and actress are wonderful,directoris wonderful so the film is wonderful! I hope most of people in theworld saw that film and put in order their family's life.Picturegoersmust saw that film....You LOVE this film like me!(don't forget to takewith handkerchief to go to the cinema.)Anyone who watches ""My father and my son"" will eventually relate themovie to a family relationship they have lived. It is a perfectvisualization of what people do because of their ego and what canactually destroy that ego. The movie makes the viewer ask ""what if""questions about almost everything and the answers will be different foreveryone. The acting is definitely remarkable with less experiencedcharacters (including the little kids) putting on a display to rememberwhen aiding patriots of Turkish movie industry. Overall I can say that""Babam ve Oglum"" is a blending of great acting, wonderful script, and areal life story.The acting was perfect in this movie from the kid (Deniz) to ÇetinTekindor (Hüseyin Aga). All player did their job in a greatperformance. Also the places the film shot was great. My grandfatherlives in a similar village, and I used to go to there in summers in myearly ages. I went to back again to my childhood when I was watchingthe movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very goodmanner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed thedrama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenlywhen you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, agreat directing success for the new generation director, Çagan Irmak.So, this a ""must to see"" film I think, especially for the Turkishviewers (It includes so much domestic features). But internationalviewers can also get a real good taste of it, because main themes (suchas family bonds, love of son) in the movie are humane things.This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It'sa small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987.Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely throughword-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and hasbecome the third-biggest grossing film of the country's history bymid-March (it could go even higher, considering it's still playing intheaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubtit'll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It'swell-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, andespecially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm willbe lost on international audiences i'm afraid. Similarly, the filmdoesn't give much information about the political events that unfold inthe background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is thatit reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from theindustry's heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerkermelodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bitsare rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that atissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to theingoing audiences, don't know if it's true though. My one (small)problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess theywouldn't even be noticed by someone who wasn't around then and there.If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way(not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It's worth watching justto see the little kid in the leading role."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The first viewing left mespeechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.  I thought itwas the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easytarget to blame.  It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a wasteof time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what itwas supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place,and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wickedperson ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too.So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil andpeople who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh andobserve what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the sametime brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't reallyexplain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it veryoften, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anythingabout it.  In essence, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the ultimate satire, and oneof the ultimate film experiences.  It's art, it's life, and in a funky way,it's entertaining.i just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away,namely the main character, protagonist, hero? Alex. we love, hate, andor just plain utterly confused about how we feel of Alex. Alex is thegreatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst ofourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surfaceeventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you.the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks meout, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hateme, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be goodwithout the bad, and i am the bad.A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick hascreated the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is aprotest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, andthe message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in alleternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonicnature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like itis, this being because the message of the film is overwhelminglypowerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number ofpossible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only byKubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaningbehind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick'sdirection is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadowsand angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, donein a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film.The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achievesthe most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliestforms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style andimportance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what isso great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe bestexplained by watching the film itself.This is just possibly the most ""perfect"" movie ever made. There is nomeaningless dialog; not a single extraneous character; and every plottwist is rational and reasonable. Not to mention a superb soundtrack.Because of the intense violence, particularly against women, it is adisturbing and difficult film to sit through. But if you care about thecinema, you must watch without interruption! Characters get what theydeserve...in the beginning and at the climax. Let Kubrick take you onthe emotional rollercoaster of your cinematic life. And don't forget tobreathe."	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Some 23 years later, the existential plight of TravisBickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. Infact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of thisfilm - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy TimesSquare, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, themagnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, thememorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle allmust be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily aresult of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatestactor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film andrates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on thecontrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions.Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same lonelinessmost humans have experienced at different times in different measures.It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese deliversit like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenithof his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we,well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiarat the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to lifewith the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more oftenthan not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the livesof the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it.Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continuestartling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he didwas compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" becamesuch an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it.Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killerand New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with itsunderbelly up.

""Lawrence of Arabia"" ishands-down the finest production of the 1960s and makes a strong case as thebest movie ever made. The titled character (Oscar-nominee Peter O'Toole inhis career-defining role) dies in a freak motorcycle accident in theearly-1930s in his homeland of England. In spite of being honored by thenation, many knew nothing of him. Some loved him, others despised him, butno one seemed to know the man at all. Flashbacks immediately start as wemeet the character during World War I. He is a lieutenant assigned tomundane duties, but suddenly he is thrust into a greater role in NorthAfrica. He is to assist a Saudi Arabian prince (Alec Guinness). The goal isto fight off the dreaded Turkish regime that poses a threat to the Arabs. Ifthe Turks take over this land in Africa, what will it mean for the English?This concern leads to those in charge (most notably Claude Rains) wantingthe titled character to help the Arabs to win their freedom back from theTurks. With the help of allies Omar Sharif (Oscar-nominated) and AnthonyQuinn, among a whole host of others, O'Toole starts to assist the Arabs intheir all-or-nothing task. An ambitious American journalist (Arthur Kennedy)wants to tell O'Toole's story in the hopes of getting the U.S. interested inthe war (basically trying to get his nation involved in World War I bypresenting them with a larger-than-life hero). During the venture O'Toolebecomes a bit war-crazed and looks at himself as a sort of Christ-likefigure who thinks of himself as immortal. O'Toole proves to be someone whois very at home in combat and when the combat is over, will he be able tofunction properly? Franklin J. Schaffner's ""Patton"" benefited greatly fromDavid Lean's (Oscar-winning for directing) masterpiece. This Best PictureOscar winner from 1962 just grows in importance as the years pass by.""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a thinking person's film that is much, much deeperthan it appears on the surface (and it appears deep on the surface to startwith). The film deals with a slice of history that really did not seem thatimportant back during World War I, but the situations in the Middle East noware greatly due to T.E. Lawrence's acts nearly a century ago. Did leadingthe Arabs to freedom make the world a safer place? This is the main questionthat Lean's film raises. Guinness' character is someone who changes almostimmediately near the end of the production and it is a somewhat frighteningforeshadower of things to come. A monumental milestone in film-making thatstands so tall against all the other great productions of all eras. 5 starsout of 5.    The fact that 744 people on the Internet Movie Database gave Lawrenceof Arabia a ""1"" one the the 1-10 scale is outright obscene. Not only isLawrence of Arabia one of the best cinematic achievements of all time,and historically intriguing to boot, it's a just plain great film witha little bit of something for everyone, including a rich historicalplot, vibrant characters, great setting, and plenty of fabulouslychoreographed battle scenes. The film is also topical for today'ssociety, for example: ""Why is terrorism so popular in the middle easttoday? Well, it might just have something to do with the fact T.E.Lawrence encouraged the Arab tribes to deal with their Ottomanoccupiers using bombs and machine guns."" How anyone with eyes and earscould dislike this movie that much is beyond my comprehension."	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

No other words can describe this film exceptmarvellous. The film is so wonderfully done that the audience actually feelsas if they were in Alabama during the 1930s. This is a must see for anyoneof any age.After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the bookit was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how welldone this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read thebook, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details thatwere left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as Iknow, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; somecall it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot isvery good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, throughthe innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart fromThe Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this isthe only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I founddull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. Theperspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive andinnocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without adoubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the filmhandles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from thebrilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that thechildren are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but likethem; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find themannoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for onesecond, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance.They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, real.Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completelyridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroythings around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyoneknows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admitthat there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first,either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive,innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately,they obviously love and respect their father, and they never doanything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone orsomething. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they dobecause they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view intotheir world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting isexcellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed athow professional and convincing they were. The other actors all givegreat performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; onceagain, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings looklike when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible andwell-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. Avery memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. Irecommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone whofor one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by itbeing over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's anexcellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss thisperfect film. 10/10After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, Iviewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed.Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of thechildren who played them, and they, as with everything else in theproduction, are true to the book's spirit.Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved hisOscar.The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and theraw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed.All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much thisfilm, at the time, would've shocked.That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through theeyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here.The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour wasleft out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and AuntAlexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation ismissed.Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as acompanion piece to the classic novel.9/10'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but thisfilm does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning,especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gavehim her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, tokeep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treatothers and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn'tnecessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might beadvisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and veryfew films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A realmust-see."	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only did the film give us the opportunity to seewhat it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave usthe opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. Theway it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives willend. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; thepessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each otheragain. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; acharacteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes youthink, ""What if...?""

This is a movie that speaks foritself. Beautiful Cinematography and stellar performances by all especiallyF. Murray Abraham who carries the film. Tom Hulce was a terrific choice forthis movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter thisfilm works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozartis pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. Youcan just sense that Mozart's inspiration drove everyone on this film toperfection. A must see film for all!""Amadeus"", while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliantfilm.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at hismost remarkable: genius.  Mozart's genius was at the highest level, on parwith Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when heundertook translating Peter Shaffer's play.  Although most of the acting ison a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not shouldthey be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from thecentral thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has beenentrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in themovie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musicalgenius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his fathershow a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, theyarenot paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A.Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately,thefilm gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: thegreat C Minor Mass, the Requiem and ""Don Giovanni"".  Forman realized thatnohuman being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen suchmasterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly trueofShakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration ofgenius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too muchfor the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanksto Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius toshine through.  In that sense, ""Amadeus"" is an exercise in humility.  Fewfilms come across as blessings for those who experience them.  ""Amadeus"" isone such film.""Amadeus"" is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overallexceptional.  The film deals with the last few months of Wolfgang AmadeusMozart's (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old,washed-up musician named Antonio Salieri (Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham). Salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the youngmusician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  Salieri's jealousy mayhave led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that willnever be known.  ""Amadeus"" is an interesting commentary that tries to fillholes in history and succeeds amazingly.  By mixing fact and probablefiction, the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motionpicture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5.Before I saw this movie, I respected Mozart's genius, but his musicwasn't my cup of tea. Beethoven was more to my taste, I tended moretoward heavier classics. But this movie moved me to tears, especiallyat the end when they did Mozart's REQUIEM while he was working on whatwas to be his last piece of music. Now, I'm a Mozart fiend. This was agreat movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone whohas studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart withhis Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does makethis story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruinationof Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historicalaccuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director's cut to thismovie. Until I saw the director's cut, Sallieri seemed like a moresympathetic character, someone who just couldn't buy a break. Who can'tidentify with that? But after seeing the director's cut and seeing whatI think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart's wife, heseemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was sorude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see thenext to the last scene and you think, ""Whoa! Where did this come from?""This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you wanthistorical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from thelibrary or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozartfan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad atall.F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, a hard working but mediocre composerdriven mad by the arrival of a ``natural'' talent, Mozart (played by TomHulce) in a highly political environment.  The movie provides some crucialinsights into the motivations of the characters, and shows both asuperficial image and reveals deeper truths (e.g. Mozart appears to partyall the time, but is actually a very diligent worker).I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy, but this movie (i) wasentertaining, (ii) inspired a greater love and knowledge of Mozart's Music,(iii) dramatized the undoing of a great talent by both external forces andhis own weaknesses (iv) has great costumes and music and (v) has a greatsupporting cast."	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The filmis harsh and doesn't turn a blind eyeto the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrickis the true master of atmosphere infilm. He makes you feel like you arethere. Friends of mine have commentedthat they only like the first half ofthe film and that the second halffalls apart. I believe Kubrick sets upthe first half to be an understandablereflection of the terror that wouldeventually enter the lives of thesesoldiers during war. It is easy toidentify with being picked on becausewe all have in some way. Not all ofus, on the other hand, have fought inwar. Kubrick is the master.  One of the greatest war movies ever, a statement very few will dispute.I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done itbefore me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick'smodernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again atwar, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days withthe way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying.Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realizeNOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killingmachines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people theycome to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reasonaccording to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complainshalf-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam.Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymnafter fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they tryin vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction.Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - andunfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us. I also wishGeorge Bush and his advisers had seen this masterpiece and - most ofall - understood its message.

Certainly a film that leavesyou thinking that you'd like to have been in Henry's gang and played apart in separating Lonnegan from his dough. The editing is pin sharpand beautifully cast with a superb musical track to keep you company.The framing, the photography, the pace all dovetail exquisitely and ifyou feel left outside of the game plan in your first viewing, neverfear, the second time of watching, you'll enjoy it just as much but itwill mean more. Certainly it's a film you'll want to see a second time.At least. Oscars rightly by the handful and nominations are fulldeserved to combine for a winning performance by all concerned.Definitely in my top fifty of all time.A magical plot, dead on art direction, brilliant supporting roles (mostnotably Robert Shaw, ya falla?), and the guiding hand of Redford/Newmanchemistry make this one of the Hollywood's great films.  ""The Sting"" is ahallmark of the ""Golden Age"" of American film, and has molded not onlycountless films, but numerous genres, few of which have met the challengeofits master.Great comedy-crime caper with giants Newman and Redfordrekindling their ""Butch & Sundance"" flame to take downcrime lord Robert Shaw (his finest role). Marvin Hamlischbeautifully recreates Scott Joplin's great music, whiledirectorGeorge Roy Hill and screenwriter David S.

The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!)2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the hieght of his style.3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene.4) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are fewand far between. ""Ladri Di Biciclette"" (translated ""The Bicycle Thief"") isquietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economicallydistraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate pathfast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town,but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy abicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikesimmediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani ison the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not asimportant as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola takeit upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle andbring the thief to justice. ""The Bicycle Thief"" was originally released in1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film thefollowing year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It isstill a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperatemeasures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio DeSica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. Itexamines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement,alliances and mental anguish perfectly. ""The Bicycle Thief"" is an excellentproduction that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about manysubjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.A film of real life, real emotions, real people. Bicycle Thieves was a film like no other because it was made like no other. With non actors, natural light, filmed on locations, the film captured the truth of Neorealism. The film is made up of a series of ""small moments."" The fact is, the entire movie is made up of pureness. It tackles issues of class, politics, and post war activities. Overall, the film is about life and hope. The unhappy ending only makes the film more real. If you are a son who loved his father and understood who he was and why he was the way he was........watch this movie."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For some reason it wasn't a success at thebox office in India. In New York, however, I have yet to come across aperson who disliked this movie. This is definitely the funniest movie tocome out of India.  Everyone gives a good performance; Amir Khan; however,just takes over and puts the movie over the top.There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you comeacross and yet happen to be  box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, anintelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indiandirector has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churnedout a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax.The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplishthat by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while alot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheercomedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, whileSalman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. Thevillian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and ""Kaliaa""make you laugh in your sleep.Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddycamerawork, and despite being ""loud"" at times, it remains one of the scarce""funny"" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal andother Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at thebox-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity isabandoned.It's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It is one of thefunniest movies I have ever seen. It never lags, it never slows down, itisa movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with thebrilliantwriting makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, evenRaveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shaktideliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe arethe best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh,and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, youwillnot regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when itends, cause it's an amazing flick.Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both of them get into Raveena's house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are complicated as Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).Andaaz Apna Apna is the most comic movie of the decade.You can't stoplaughing during the movie.Right from the first scene to the last, yourgiggles don't stop.Amir Khan is brilliant.His comic timing issuperb.His dialogue delivery, gestures,uninhibited style all compel youto laugh like hell.Salman Khan is good.Paresh Rawal is his usualbest.The dialogues by Rajkumar Santoshi are good(Amir Khan mouthingPurush-Mahapurush).The music reminds you of good old times.The sceneswhere both the characters Amar Prem try to outwit each other,they tryto woo Raveena and the fighting scenes in the Climax are reallyfunny.It is very difficult to decide which is the most comic scene.Allof them are on top of other.Definitely one of the best feathers inRajKumar Santoshi's Cap. I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genreof Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies).i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even thoughit is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilariousand the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laughlike they've never laughed before.

What Pixar does is not just absorb theyounger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. Itcompletely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level ofmaturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certainmagical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone asa child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their ownadventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does notattract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather withits material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is thenext most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people thinktheir is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there isto a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to itsmaterial and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the filmand its characters.Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give thefolks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short ofbrilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement isquite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as closeto human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditionalhand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to myheart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and atop notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It'sobvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionistswhen it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,somethingrarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters arewelldone, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film isentirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it'sability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film alsoteaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly betweenWoodyand Buzz Light-year).

Thecharactersare so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy youwant to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jonesreveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a prettyface and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as IrishMickey. See this movie!!!!Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit asastonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seenpeople in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. VinnieJones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. Hisappearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not onscreen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio ofpawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie startpersonna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie.Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities.However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard tounderstand.Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expertdirection and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laughmore than any other movie this year.

Without theirscreenplay the movie does not get made. It is a great script that was madebetter by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens' fluid direction. Everything in thismovie glides effortlessly. Throw in dancing by Donald O'connor, DebbieReynolds, Cyd Charisse and of course Gene Kelly, Great songs and thewillingness of producer Arthur Freed to let the creative people to do theirthing and you have a classic.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tarantino doesn't care if he offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot isvery superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this filmactually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and showthat the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloodyvicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with themost notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about thekilling of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris isunbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killingin the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at theend is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned greatreviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films.will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, aswell. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but heyreconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfedthe whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought andsuffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It is a silent movie but so rich, winning and beautiful that you don´tnead words. Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charmingpair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light andfull of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get myeyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry inmovies.And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full offeeling, touchingly funny moments. It is truly a masterpiece showing howextraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film isrespectively over 80 years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age,don´t miss it. Charlie Chaplin's study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid (the cutelittle Jackie Coogan) has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos,and true to what you would expect of his best work, does it superbly.  Thetramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding alittleboy to the mix was the finishing touch.  Look out too for little Lita Greyin the angel sequence, who would become Chaplin's 2nd wife four yearsafterthis film was made."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Confidential most likely falls into the category of one of the bestmovies of the past twenty years. The complex story line seemed to burst atthe seams with intelligence.  I found the complexity of several differentsub-plots working together challenged the intellectual part of my brainwhile the intense action through out the entire movie satisfied thecravingof the not-so-intellectual part of my brain that enjoys seeing a goodbrawlfollowed by a good shoot-out.  Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did andexcellent job of combining many elements of several different kinds offilmsinto one.  They seem to have made this movie with several differentaudiences in mind.  I for one, as I have mentioned, enjoyed theintellectualaspect as well as the action, while my wife enjoyed the combination of alove story with drama.  It really has something for everyone.  Bringingtogether all of these elements into one film sets it apart from manyothers.Of course the best aspect of L.A. Confidential is the way that noteverything is as it seems, and then, in an instant, all of the plots aresprung like a trap and come together for a grand finale.  Overall L.A.Confidential is an exceptional film that contains something for everyone.""L.A. Confidential"" is brilliant.  The screenplay and direction aresecond-to-none.  The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb.KimBasinger stands out the most with her Oscar-winning role.  Kevin Spacey,Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, and DannyDeVito all have their moments as well.  The film deals with the seamy sideof Los Angeles in the post-World War II 1950s.  Los Angeles is a place ofshady dealings and police corruption.  To add to those problems is thecreation of the smutty tabloid.  Multi-layered and smart, ""L.A.Confidential"" will be the greatest survivor of the films released in 1997.5 out of 5 stars.   Although this movie 'flopped' at the box office at $53 million, thisjust may be one the smartest movies you haven't seen. With greatperformances from an ensemble all-star cast and a clever script, thedramatic tension of this modern film-noir classic is an absolutemust-see! Told through a variation on the theme of ""good cop, bad cop""with an overarching corruption angle, this film cleverly deals withissues of racism, social justice and ethics in a non-discriminatorymanner. Character development is well-done and the dramatic tension issuperb. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, youwon't be disappointed!Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shockedthe world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with thisunbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruptionand crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detectivestory angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because JeannineClaudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50sto such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to thatDante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artisticand believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers'costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe BrianHelgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammothplot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman withsuspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or thespiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997,not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since OrsonWelles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basingeras a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind ofsteel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll findyourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a DeanMartin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle,he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can'tget enough of this film."	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Most people seem go for 'TheGood, The Bad And The Ugly' as the best of the three movies, but I think'For A Few Dollars More' just beats it. Anyway, there's no argument thatthey are three brilliant films, Eastwood is super cool in all of them, Leoneis on top form, particularly in this one, and Ennio Morricone's scores areamazing stuff. 'For A Few Dollars More' is helped enormously by Lee VanCleef playing Colonel Mortimer, and the scenes between him and Eastwood, andthe ones between him and Klaus Kinski are pure gold. This is not only one ofthe best westerns ever made, but one of the best movies of any genrereleased in the 1960s. It was also a highly influential one. I can't imaginePeckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' for example existing without Leone. Words failme praising movies as brilliant as this one. All I can say is WATCH IT NOW.Or if you've already seen it WATCH IT AGAIN!Excellent fun with sadistic humor from Leone.  Eastwood's best performancein a Leone film.  Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson's in""Once Upon a Time in the West"".  He is menacing and sympathetic, whereas in""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" he is just campy and all ""bad guy"" (butstill fun).  What makes both performances so memorable I think is that VanCleef seems to be in touch with Leone's dark humor, where Eastwood is usedas a straight man.  Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used(an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audienceof earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man).  A much better filmthan most people who've seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probablyrealize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the fullhit.This movie is the second best western i have ever seen with The Good,The Bad, The Ugly being first. I disagree with someone who wrote thatthis movie is not as good as A Fistful of Dollars. This movie is waybetter than a fistful of dollars. The reason is (as i pointed out in myother post) is that Clint's role or character is better when he has agood supporting member because it gives Clint's character more depth aswell as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent inhis role, i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising tosee him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their ownstyles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth tothis one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In afistful of dollars Gian didn't have much depth at all and some of thecharacters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the charactersinto each other in this one, having all of their stories somehow play arole in the other ones. If you haven't seen this movie i suggest youwatch Leone's films in chronological order with A fistful of dollarsfirst, this one second, and finish it off with the good the bad theugly. You'll be glad you did.One of my favorite movie lines of all time as spoken by Klaus Kinski uponrecognizing Lee Van Cleef in the little cantina as the one who used his(Klaus') cheek to strike his match earlier in the movie.  When Kinski askifhe ""remember me, amigo,"" Van Cleef just reply ""uh uh.""  To which he'saskedto try that trick again, which prompts Van Cleef to utter another one ofmyall time lines - ""I generally don't smoke 'til after I've eaten; why don'tyou come back in five minutes.""  Just typing this brings smiles to myface.I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon (with Robert Wilke) andKansasCity Confidential (with Jack Elam and Neville Brand!) and this was/is themovie that made him a star.  Granted it didn't last for long, but he didhave his 15 minutes.  This is my favorite Spaghetti Western, it was alsomyfirst (didn't see ""Fistful"" until much later - and Good, Bad, Ugly was amajor disappointment - I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role).  And themusic, especially the pipe organ, just blows my mind.  Highly enjoyable;think I'll go and watch it again."	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana(Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomesthe ""king"" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crimein Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenesare unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ F-words and isalmost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will neverget bored. You cheer for the Drug-lord, and in some scenes you find outthat Montana isn't as evil as some other Crime Lords. This is amasterpiece and i recommend that you see this. You will not bedisappointed. 9/10Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small timehood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, andhe does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his ballsand his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobsfor a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quicklygoes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friendManny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wifeElvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to hisposition, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upsetand nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting castamong them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiarface is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, MarryElizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellentscreenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma'sBrightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guyis very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also payattention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant(""Say goodnight to the bad guy""). the other is the final shootout whereTony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the mostimpressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacinoand crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highlyrecommended. 10/10"	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

And there are very few over the age ofconsent who haven't had to at one time or another. This isn't the laughout loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle,nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love andyet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out forthem -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they areboth basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, butgood people. This is a movie that doesn't just make it you laugh, itmakes you think. A rare find indeed.One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever createdfor the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a workingstiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartmentinadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. Thefilm is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage offunny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yetsympathetic) characterization, and ""The Apartment"" catches him at hisprofessional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neuroticShirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlayinghis slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind ofacting: screwball realism.  from Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" is a film which can produce some of thebiggest laughs and at the same time... can bring many viewers to tears,Billy Wilder's quaint little tale about everyday people who get tangledup in love, jealousy and infidelity boasts a top-notch cast led by thetrio of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray who are tremendous. The plotrevolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethicalattempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment tomembers from his management chain to entertain their 'women on theside'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly couldeven hit home in the current office environment. Although the officeparty and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the powerand attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) iscertainly symbolic. The character of Fran (MacLaine) for today'sstandards of course seems too submissive and vulnerable but the rewardof her finding true, admirable, unconditional companionship is quiteenriching and fulfilling to any who see this memorable film."	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In his third (andwhat for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on thehunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he mustcontend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. SeanConnery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistrybetween he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in filmhistory. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo eachpreceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have troubleinterpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages willenjoy.The second sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is an awesome, beautifullycrafted film, and arguably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Thefilm is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other twowoody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellentSean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get backon track after their off the rails first sequel in which to manypeoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raidersso unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic isthe use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline ofadventure and action. Not to mention that this may well be the greatestfeel good film ever made...An ideal action-comedy/adventure if there ever was one; in thisentertaining third installment archaeologist Ford must travel to Italyin 1938 to try and rescue his estranged father. However, the rescuemission soon turns into a historic quest as he seeks out the HolyGrail, once again finds himself battling Hitler's Nazis, and againencounters dangerous perils every step of the way. Follows basicallythe same formula as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Connery is an addedbonus as Ford's father and the two make a perfect duo. A good blend ofelements as the film provides lots of exciting, cliffhanger actionscenes/stunts, memorable lines, and genuine humor, but the relationshipbetween the two leads is what really gives it stability. Lots of fun.½	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

It is so well-crafted; the twists of the plot throwup new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are exploredsensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstreamAmerican films. I felt sympathy for all the characters, even thethreatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often eruptsvolcanically. And as a footnote, the film felt like an intimate viewinto a society that our news media portray as monochromatic andextremely foreign. (I am writing this a few days after the UK embassyin Tehran was ransacked)I think this movie is the savior of Iranian cinema.Asghar Farhadi is asmart director and all of his movies are talking about Iranian society.Nowadays religious intolerance is the main problem of Iranian societyand Farhadi decided to show this matter in his latest film.We have toappreciate him because at the age of poor Iranian movies we have abrilliant movie on screens. About the actors , that is the secondexperience of Peyman Moaadi who had seen before in last Farhadi's film(About Eli 2009), but he acted more professional than he is , as anintolerant person and doesn't let his family to go to abroad. Aboutactresses , Leila Hatami & Sareh Bayat performed unconventionally greatand I think that was the most important movie that they have ever actedin. I hope it will win the Best Foreign Language Film title in 84thAcademy Awards. Good Luck for Iranian Movies , Directors , Actors &Actresses and .....	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

You can see it's influence in films such as Star Wars,The Matrix, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Lovethe Bomb, Blade Runner, and countless others. Despite the fact thatparts of the film are no longer available, the efforts to reconstructthe original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enoughto make the story clear. The special effects were far ahead of theirtime and the set designs were, in some cases, phenomenal. I can seewhere some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some toreally appreciate a movie that is 77 years old, because a lot hashappened in film since then. Yet, if you look at the basic elements ofthis movie - its story, characters, artwork, cinematography, etc., Ibelieve this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in thelate 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of Germanexpressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designsare going to be over the top. That was part of the style. Metropolismay not be for everyone, but, for those willing to read between thelines, this film still has a lot to offer!I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie. This is without a doubtthe best sci-fi movie I've ever seen! Let me explain my position. We have allseen modern sci-fi movies, and argued over which is the best ever made, butthose film makers have high speed film and computers. Imagine trying to make amovie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in 1925, and even ifyou used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must seefor all persons interested in the history of film, as well as just good funfor everyone. The social metaphores as well as the religious andphilosophical double meanings are a sight to behold.I doubt that I'd ever seen anything resembling a ""complete"" version ofMETROPOLIS before, though certain of its scenes were familiar to me, if onlyas used and abused in such films as Diane Keaton's HEAVEN (1987).  In anycase, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty ofthe Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration'stechnique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but thenarrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, someperformances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced andlayered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang'smuscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought ofMETROPOLIS as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now I've come toappreciate it as the seminal work it has always been.Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before,but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I couldfairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a publicdomain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and whilethere were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent thattheir context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the bestway to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of thissupposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by criticsbecause they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored andexpanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time inthe West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of themovie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculationpolitical parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. Itdepicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers,who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, whodwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered sonof the city's supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomesconcerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpseof Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, isplotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang,who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One ofthe most surprising things about watching this version is just how muchI didn't see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD alsoincludes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot befound in any version. With these changes, the story becomes muchclearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master ofMetropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is addedinvolving the hero's dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his fatherand Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close butadversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes muchclearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Warsmovies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn't the story,which is pretty silly and probably wouldn't have worked in anything buta silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale andambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, thoughin most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in whichthey have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequentlygrandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show thehellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city'stowering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film.Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) specialeffects, Lang's visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Mariaprovides some of the movie's most iconic images, including hertransformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs forupper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease thatin 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen isfilled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang's visual lavishness,and the studio's, that he doesn't hesitate to throw in lavish dream andhallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate acharacter's state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters thesubterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on hugemachines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol'shead into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point,while he's sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sinscoming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Mariapreaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, shetells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. laborparable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower'sconstruction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would haveseemed redundant and over-literal, but they're what silent cinema doesbest -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. Thestory is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolisbecomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I've seen.In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematicpossibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of theearliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines,endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury andnihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what wasgoing to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made.  Its scope, itsreach, its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by today'sstandards of film-making.  Seen in context of its premier in 1927,Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history.  Lots of people alwaysask what makes a movie great, and in particular, Metropolis.  A great filmis one that stirs the imagination, leaves the viewer with images that willlast perhaps forever, forces contemplation of issues dealing with the veryessence of life, and achieves a kind of immortality.  Metropolis is a filmthat succeeds with each of these criteria.  Metropolis is a film that hailedin a new era of making films with it futuristic settings, halluciatoryscenes, and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope, most clearly exhibited byits cast of epic proportions.  There are images that blind the viewer withgenius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or thecreation of the robot Maria.  Metropolis challenges its viewers to thinkabout their relationship with society both as a whole and with eachindividual, as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongstpeoples and groups.  Lastly, Metropolis has stood the test of time.  It is alandmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the sciencefiction/fantasy film genre.  The story itself is simple,a Biblical allegory,about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make ithappen.  The film is anything but simple.  It is immense, and a rich legacythat director Fritz Lang has left us. Silent movies are not for everyone. Neither are subtitles. Those brave enoughto view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between shoulddefinitely enjoy this silent masterpiece. One of the biggest productions ofits time, Metropolis still holds its own when set design and specialeffects are compared. But what Metropolis really has is orginality. ThisGerman-Expressionist film had such originality in everything from itscostumes to its views of a future (modern) city that its ideas can still beseen everywhere in modern sci-fi. Star Wars's C-3PO was based on BridgetteHelm's robot. Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis look-a-like cities.This is a very good movie. It's too bad most movies don't have itsoriginality.Fritz Lang's groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggestmysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that'll soon turn 80years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay byThea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails socialissues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two maincategories: thinkers & workers! If you belong to the first category,you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker, yourlife isn't worth a penny, and you're doomed to perilous laborunderground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay aretoo astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out thefilm yourself. It's essential viewing, anyway! ""Metropolis"" is a verydemanding film-experience and definitely not always entertaining. But,as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect andadmiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel theenjoyment-aspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative andfew directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarishcomposition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly'restored' versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in myopinion, even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual asLang intended it. ""Metropolis"" perhaps is THE most important andinfluential movie ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and""Blade Runner"" owe their existence (or at least their power) to it."	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I agree with previous reviewers, this is anexcellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think togo through it without being brought to tears at one point or another.You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what areyou doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you alwaysunderstand where each character is coming from- you might not agreewith their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic.Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before,and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It'sa tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but atthe same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful. Ireally loved it.I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival andI walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tellbut the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The filmdoesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn'treally any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of onecoin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film isvery intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film ismostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The cameralikes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyesthat tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was notbeing said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen isstunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays therole with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps youguessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of theinnocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing.Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on filmthis year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot endsquite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into theepilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performancesfrom the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film iswithout giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers forsuch a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would Ido?Sometimes children lie.Sometimes good people give in to hysteria, and lose all sense of reason.Sometimes they destroy innocent lives.The Hunt (aka Jagten) is the latest offering from Denmark that will knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing, Borgen and The Bridge, Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking, harrowing experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable. More than that, it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no smoke without fire.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a lonely teacher, divorced from his wife, kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who has earned the respect of his peers, the love of a new girlfriend and the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be chased around the playground by him.Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) has an innocent, childish crush on Lucas when two situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an explicit pornographic image and, secondly, Lucas gently chastises her for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination, childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences, Klara makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes.For only the fifth time so far this year, I believe I have witnessed a near-perfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay, the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and frequently astounding.Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A Single Man, so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him.Equally, both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at the screen ""Don't be so stupid,"" or to scream expletives at Grethe (Susse Wold) the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas' son, Marcus, Lasse Fogelstrøm gives a heartfelt performance segueing seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his distress is a warning to those given over to rumours.The surprise, no, the absolute shock, with the casting is Wedderkopp. In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by over-enthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion alone.The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Oscars, I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't sit in front of the screen expecting a light, easy, thought provoking flick. I emerged numb, angry, helpless and terrified. But for one careless or cruel comment, it could happen to me.Or you."	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

First of all the script. I think it had areal slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's becausethey lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion anytime I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to daylife. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, youweren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example,William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that hesneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know peoplelike that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'llsave you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- thequestion is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing ofcourse. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- thecourage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a partof real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash""as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren'ttrash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, lifeand courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times lifeknocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. Theydefinitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I amsad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty""said... LOOK CLOSER.I am totally dumbfounded by some of the reactions to this film.  I'mimagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame ofmind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worththe price of a cinema ticket.  Then there are the people calling itunrealistic.  Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to thecentral character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn'tuse my intelligence until very recently.  Instead I took to taking drugs anddrinking and swearing!  Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, butnow I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technicalUniversity in the UK.  Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and Ilive in England) why can't so many others?This film is a veritable jewel.  The script is one of the best I've everseen.  The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kindof colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like The Catcher in theRye'.  Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, getin touch with your inner Robin Williams'.  But thankfully the script or GusVan Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board.  Look at the finalscene where they're hugging and saying their farewells.  Now this could haveoverlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines `Doesn't thiscontravene the Doctor, patient relationship?'  `Only if you grab my ass'were uttered so as to diffuse it.  Then bear in mind that you never actuallysee the reunion between Skylar and Will!  I could go on forever arguingagainst people's criticisms.  But what's the point if certain viewers can'tappreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire scriptand the superb performances by the cast.   It's these same viewers whoshall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings ofHollywood mainstream.  Let them watch this chewing gum for the mind' and wediscerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.  I think a quoteis in order here directed to all you viewers who deemed this film boring orunrealistic `If ignorance is bliss, there should be more happypeople.'I first saw Good Will Hunting in February of '98.  It blew me away.  Ihappily disregard comments by people who say: ""The probability of somethinglike that happening...""  This film is bold in that giving Will such a mindcolors outside of the lines.  It simply aims to tell a story.  It is abeautiful story told in a magnificent manner.  Robin Williams was superb inhis role, his effect on Damon electric.  Minnie Driver and Matt Damon'son-screen chemistry was undeniable.  More films like this one are needed.And yes, the ending was predictable.  That made it perfect.  I wouldn't havehad it any other way."	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

A literary script that istotally accessible. A melodrama for the thinking man. A film that is asengrossing and entertaining every time you see it. Bette Davis touchesall the raw nerves of her mythological career. Anne Baxter never wentthis far. Thelma Ritter became a sort of icon. Marilyn Monroe gives usa preview of forthcoming attractions as a graduated from the""Copacabana"" academy of dramatic arts. Celeste Holm represents us, allof us and George Sanders creates a prototype for a cultured monsterthat is immediately recognizable. I don't recall another film in whichthe nature of selfishness is so wittily dissected. A total triumph.All About Eve is simply the perfect film. Fact follows fiction in thecasting of Bette Davis, a star who was an incredible actress butfighting the inevitable - the passage of time. First off, Better Daviswas always an incredible actress, no matter what part she took and thiswas the perfect part for her. Anne Baxter is tremendous in the part ofEve - she plays the part well. It's multi-faceted and challenging andshe definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She'sgot a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is anactress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of hercareer, like when she was in that television show ""Promised Land."" ButAddison DeWitt - takes the cake. I can see why he won the Oscar. Idon't want to say much about the story. The film is one that has to betaken in as a whole to be truly appreciated. Enjoy it - it's as tastyas honey! One thing - please never let them make a re-make of this film- it's perfect. It's off limits. It would be painting a new version ofthe Mona Lisa. This one is perfect!What can you say about a film like this? It has one of the greatestscreenplays ever written, fabulous directing, and sensational performancesby Anne Baxter, Bette Davis and George Sanders. And on top of it all, it'sgot Marilyn Monroe! What more could you want?!? It's full of snappydialogue, great one liners, and a realistic and interesting plot. Theepitome of good movie making. Oh, if only today's filmmakers were forced towatch All About Eve before they were allowed to make their own!All About Eve is an excellent film in every aspect. The 14 Oscarnominations, and six wins, testify to this. For 47 years EVE held therecord for most nominations -- in 1997 Titanic matched the 14nominations. Bette Davis was awarded the New York Critics Award once inher 58 year career -- and it was for this film. Marilyn Monroe, ThelmaRitter and Celeste Holms gave terrific supporting performances whileAnne Baxter kept up with the great Bette every frame of the way. It wasBette's eighth nomination, and sixth loss; Judy Holiday won for BornYesterday, beating two legends -- Gloria Swanson was also nominatedthat year for Sunset Blvd. All About Eve was the first film to bereleased after Bette ended her 18 years with Warner Brothers. For amoment she was back on top of the world, only to find disappointmentthroughout the 50's with choices and offerings in Hollywood. Thewriting by Mankiewicz and supporting performance by George Saunderswould alone make the film worth viewing -- A NEAR PEFECT FILM!Here's perfect writing if ever a movie ever had it-where did Joseph L.Mankiewicz come up with these people? Who would have thought he could notonly revive Bette Davis' career with her greatest-ever role, but actuallymake her even more fascinating than she ever was before? Davis plays famousand established actress Margo Channing, a self-centred and tough butvulnerable woman who is purused relentlessly by Eve Harrington (AnneBaxter), a seemingly innocent woman who worships Channing-she even becomesher personal assistant. However, her devotion soon becomes sinister, andMargo lets her friends know, though they just think she's being selfish andunfair. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's best friend, who at first is onEve's side but eventually sees how conniving Eve can be and how ruthless sheis in climbing to the top. The party scene early on in the film featuressome of the film's best lines (`Fasten your seat beltsit's going to be abumpy night!'), though my personal favourite is when Davis tells Baxter toput her award `where you heart should be'; Margo Channing is just about thebest female character of the fifties. Features Marilyn Monroe in an earlyrole.

Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samuraiwalking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai,played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. Thissamurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn'tlet you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head andhis profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinemahistory. The film has been copied many times, its practically the mostinfluential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packedhowever, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The factthat this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is differentthan most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the leadrole. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't oncamera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of adirector and actor with confidence in their craft. I'm not going to waste time debating which was the ""greatest"" or ""best"" ofKurosawa's movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it's'Yojimbo'. 'Rashomon' and 'Throne Of Blood' are probably deeper and moresubstantial, but for sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat!Being a Kurosawa movie it's no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. Thetwo made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watchthe most. I love looking at Mifune's face! His expressions are awesome. Hewas without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars.'Yojimbo' was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically'A Fistful Of Dollars', but before you bay for Sergio Leone's blood, pleaseread Dashiell Hammett's detective classic 'Red Harvest', published in 1929and you'll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it.  I see no mentionwhatsoever of this source material in the credits for 'Yojimbo', so let'sjust leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincinglyargued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westernsanyway. Walter Hill later ""remade"" 'Yojimbo' (or 'Red Harvest' depending onyour perspective) as 'Last Man Standing' and David Lynch gave a small nod toit in his 'Wild At Heart'.  You can certainly see both the samurai andspaghetti influences in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 1 and 2, that's for sure. ""Influences"", ""inspirations"", these are things that go around and around,it's what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. 'Yojimbo' is aclassic action movie. Maybe only 'Wages Of Fear' is better. Every film buffneeds this movie in their collection!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Imust say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into themovie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is themovie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros.finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film,apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan'sdecision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could reallyexist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Anotheraspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focusbeing on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It'samazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, andthe creative team alone, and allow them to make the best moviepossible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmesand the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenagerplaying grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that youreally don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, Ifelt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited tooquickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what wasgoing on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute thisto the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the nextfilm will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman usethe martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart fromthose relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'mdefinitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a secondtime. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

It's a rare film that makes me laugh out loud, but I definitelymade some noise watching this one! Jack Lemmon gave one of the mosthysterical performances I've ever seen; add Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe,andone hell of a script and you have the classic comedy that all others musttry to live up to. I'd give this move a 15 if they'd letme.Why a man would want to marry another man? asks Tony Curtis, Security!Jack Lemmon replays without missing a beat. Clearly he had put thequestion to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensibleconclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought socleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of ourthree characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be todayand more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes humannature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our mostendearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, thesadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting.Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming,imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll bealways be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himselfinto the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end itscourse with a line like ""Nobody's perfect""A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. ""Nobody's perfect""may be an inherent truism, but ""Some Like it Hot"" is a definite somebody inthe universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex andslapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying todescribe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities thatone cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does.Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshellof thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire solong as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, forsocio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, butthere's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the doubleentendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers (""What do I do if it's an emergency? - Pull the emergency break!"" ), including overtly gay themes that have acult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful,unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday.Though not a Musical, the combustive energy of this movie is so stimulatingit almost makes you get up and dance.  Some Like it Hot will have a Danish re-premiere on Marilyn Monroes 75thbirthday June 1st 2001, and making the text for some advertising materialinthat connection I saw the movie again and liked it more than ever. Mostcomedies about men in womens' clothings have a vulgar humour. This is, ofcourse, not the case for films like ""Tootsie"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" inwhich Billy Wilder using black and white instead of colours turns down theimportance of the change of sex in many ways so that you can concentrateonthe comedy which is extraordinarily well timed with a spiritual dialogue.The acting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, not to mentionJoe E Brown, Pat O'Brien and George Raft is out of this world, and ofcourseit is possible to make a mafia war comical. Some scenes almost remind youofa Marx Brothers' movie. Like when a small berth in a train sleeping car inafew seconds is overcrowded with beautiful girls mixing Manhattan-drinks intheir hot-water bottle while Jack Lemmon is desperately trying to remindhimself that -- just then -- he is a girl, and Marilyn Monroe in seconds(with her back towards the camera!) produces perfect small, squareice-cubesout of a huge ice block.

In the beginning he reluctantly becomes a gunfighter but as themovie progresses you see how he slides down the slippery slope ofwickedness to become the cold-blooded killer needed for the task.Morgan Freeman's reaction to the transformation is well played also.Richard Harris' character is colorful as is his sidekick. GeneHackman's sheriff is pleasantly atypical of the role. All these actorsand their characters effectively leave the viewer with a myriad ofdirections from which the movie expertly entertains. If you areexpecting anything like Clint's ""spaghetti westerns"" you will bedisappointed. If you are looking for an excellent story with charactersthat all have varying degrees of wickedness, you will be satisfied whenits all said and done.This film was a revelation, a western that DOESN'T LIE. The whole themestripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west,scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the uglinessAND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by theportrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A largefocus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS USwhat it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casualattitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know,wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren'tcapable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that inspite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil stillexisted then as now, and every now and then, true heroism."	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

With snappy dialogs , impeccablestory and a perfect combination of actors and actresses this iscertainly a must see. With Indian cinema being crippled by the ""HIGH""emotional dramas containing stories of ultimate suffering of impossibleproportions, Hera Pheri was the turning point, where all the bollywoodfilm industry saw the power of a simple comedy. Starring Paresh Rawal,Suniel Shetty , Akshay Kumar , Tabu , Asrani, Om Puri , Gulshan GroverHera Pheri had all the ingredients of a super hit. If you hate Indianmovies and are against all the high melodrama dose you get free with aDVD of Indian movie, Hera Pheri is just the movie for you. With asequel now being aired ""Phir Hera Pheri"" which is too good for asequel. Go watch both of these movies and have a big laugh.You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 timesandI am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and Ilovedit and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performanceofParesh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances.This movie really makes me laugh.My rating- 10/10From the first scene itself, you start laughing and keep until 'TheEnd'. Strong performances by paresh, akshay and (even) sunil. excellentscreenplay and a tight story. even the scenes like two highly desperate(sunil and tab) and unemployed struggling to secure a job inside a bankleave us laughing. Priyadarshan is really a brilliant director,crafting hilarious characters and instances from daily life. just toremind with a dialog: /not include because written in Hindi and notaccepted as spelling mistakes by IMDb/(in English: a tenant beats uphis landlord like a dog'(landlord babu Bahia alerted) 'reason - girls,babu Bahia, girls) and not to forget, nicely woven songs like 'denewalajab bhi data, deta chap par fa-ad K' add to the movie experience.A movie is funny, when you can laugh at Om Puri. In fact he brings morelaughs than the main characters. I could easily compare him to RobertDe Nero, who excelled in ""Analyze Me"" and he never envisioned himselfas a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectiouswith the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. AkshayKumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good teamwith the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same rangeas Kumar's! After ""Padosan"" there has been some sprinkling of comedy,more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever andShakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the ""sophisticatedfront bencher's"" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indianand demeaning humor produced by the ""Benchods of Bollywood"" as in filmslike ""Three Idiots"", ""Delhi Belly"" etc. The front benchers like filthsince they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen intheir life. They worship these ""Monkey's of Mumbai"" the Midget, TheUgly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the ""Media Maggots ofMumbai"" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown atthem time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap andvulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was noalternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were notfunny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writersand director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie thathas opened the flood-gate for movies like ""Mallammal Weekly"" andothers."	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

BrunoGanz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He iscompletely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably.You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. Youget a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the militarydecisions were taken during those final days of the war. The moviebalances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruinedstreets and depictions of different persons going though the experience from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to theprincipal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty andGerman civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazinor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives animpression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seatwill tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich. First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant, perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall areabsolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS, was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans. The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10"	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I have watched itatleast ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing.Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quartercentury, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMottawatched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violenttemper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excusethebad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorseseunflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and whatultimatelymay have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the mostbrutaland violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black andwhite and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows andanimalcries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker's jarring, discordant editinginthese scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domesticviolenceare not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tellthis story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we acttheway we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made mere-evaluatemy life. 10/10""Raging Bull"" is a cinematic masterpiece which pulls no punches.  Based on atrue story, Robert De Niro (in his second Oscar-winning role) stars as JakeLa Motta, a middle-weight prize-fighter from the late-1940s and early-1950s,who basically destroys himself and those around him because of anuncontrollable temper and poor decision-making.  Instead of going down asone of the greatest boxers of all time, La Motta ruined his career becausehe was unable to see the ""big picture"".  He threw bouts, he got involvedwith low-life underworld crime figures, he beat his wife (Cathy Moriarty, inher Oscar-nominated role), he abused all those closest to him, and he hadrelationships with young girls who were still considered minors.  Even hisstrongest tie, his younger brother (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-nominated,star-making part), gets cut during the course of his untimelyself-destruction.  La Motta goes from middle-weight champ to a washed-outstand-up comic at a local club.  He gains weight uncontrollably andultimately just becomes another face in the crowd by the end of the film. By the end, La Motta proclaims that he: ""Could have been a contender...."",quoting Marlon Brando's famous line from ""On the Waterfront"".  ""Raging Bull""is one of those films that is masterfully crafted in all possibledepartments.  The screenplay is one of the best in the history of film. Martin Scorsese's direction is superb and so is the cinematography (shotalmost entirely in black-and-white).  The film delivered De Niro an Oscarand also won for its editing.  ""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that isvery close to ""Citizen Kane"".  They both deal with men who desperately wantto be great, but ultimately destroy themselves and those around them.  Thisfilm is often rated the best film of the 1980s.  I cannot argue with thatopinion.  I also think that this is the best work that Scorsese and De Nirohave ever done.  The fact that this film lost the Best Picture Oscar to""Ordinary People"" in 1980 is probably the biggest disappointment since""Citizen Kane"" lost to ""How Green Was My Valley"" in 1941.  Excellent.  5stars out of 5.    Jake La Motta's story is no doubt the best movie about boxing of all timestogether with Robert Wise's The Set-Up. Besides the legendary performanceofRobert De Niro, there are many things in this film that will remain in myheart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slowmoving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the senseof loss which entangles the whole movie.

The film is spoken inFarsi, the subtitles were in Korean.  It didn't matter that I couldn'tunderstand a single word, because the cinematography and the faces of thechildren, their parents and the other cast members did all the talking.Awonderful film that dispelled my notions of Tehran as a dark andforbiddingplace - actually it's quite beautiful!  We Americans have not seen Iransince 1979 and it is my hope that soon we can restore relations again.  Iwouldn't mind visiting.What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to aculture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, afilm by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a littleboy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have ineach other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister'snewly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes theirsecret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them inthe morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent facesof the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty,provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcomea crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but itis the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up onDVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of).Wow, what can I say? Every bit of this film is so warm! It really lookedatthe world from a child's perspective. Every single scene is inundated withsweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoeswas amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidenceinher brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. Theultimatedespair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sisterare both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one totears. Do watch it!Majid Majidi is a genius. He is a director and actor of great talent.This film presents a sweet story of a brother and sister, their bondand their unique solution to solving the problem of a pair of lostshoes. The child actors are adorable and utterly convincing and theproduction of the film is of such quality that you get lost in watchingit. The story itself is humorous, at times, and inspiring. Though thepremise may be simple, each scene is infused with such passion, beautyand emotion that the experience of viewing this film is anything butsimple. To all who have yet to view the film, take note of the verylast scene.Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven is such an extraordinary work ofmovie-making that it is in a realm of movies that are able to connectwith anyone who remembers (or is amidst) their childhood, regardless ofwhat country they come from. (Note: Films that have a universal appealaren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people fromone or two countries, but making a film with a universal appeal is noeasy task.) A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sisterZahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell theirfather (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Alipromises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soonas possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switchingschedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chuckles-goodwriting and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though hemilks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able togive us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screenthan any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last tenminutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwindof emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in thatorder) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives ushomage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie issomewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies containthe feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his lifewhile Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere.Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving uswondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphantor pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) ina way I would not dream of revealing."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Having seen it for thefirst time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivatedby this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably haveseen it a ""million"" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and stillwatching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is itso great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,becauseit has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a goodlength,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give topperformances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance isbrilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,RichardAttenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest rolesDonald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historicallyaccurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't mattera bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and theirguards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I willnot repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will captureyou,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. Thereis excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will notregret it.The Great Escape is a classic war movie with plenty happening in it. Itjust so happens that it is my all time favourite having seen it 60times since it first was released. Steve McQueen , as Hilts, was thedriving force behind this movie. He seemed to tie everything togetherbetween the American and British prisoners especially in the scenewhere they were celebrating the 4th of July with the drums and good olefashioned American moonshine. The Great Escape contains one of the mostfamous movie scenes of all times when McQueen has half of the Germanarmy chasing after him while riding his motorcycle trying to jump thebarb wire fence to get to Switzerland. All in all, The Great Escape hada cast of actors that was so strong that it was a wonder they got thismovie made in the first place with all of the egos involved. JamesGarner, Charles Bronson, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, etc.wereabsolutely awesome.The Great Escape is THE prison escape movie. The film is rich withcharacters and the direction by John Sturges is great. Steve McQueen is theman and the rest of the cast are terrific. This movie is heroic and showsthe bravery of men in the second world war. I escape into this moviewhenever I feel really down, it's a great spirit lifter and one of thegreatest films of all time.Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If youlisten to it closely, it literally is a battle between the AlliedPrisoners(flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas).  The escape scenes with thelittle boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and hisheroicGermanic Operas.  The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps isbreathtaking.  I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism,humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement ofwhatis essentially a cruel and tragic story.  As a child growing up in theseventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and wehad the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisonerfrom that era.  He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but wasplaced on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that fewmenseriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was onsurviving the war and going home alive."	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Itseems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with adreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complexcharacters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is thesimilarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinatingto find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man ofphilosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn'twant to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leadsan in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is theclimax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film evermade, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad,adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale andgrandeur.In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in theusual comic-book style of most films today.  ""Heat"" carries with it themoral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film ismorally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived onthe other side of the law, you can still settle down and have aheart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be anotherviolent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seenit 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliantcamera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast ofcharacters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"".From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything inbetween (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is atrue film masterpiece.Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I havethe same opinion.The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human sideof the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro'scharacter (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determinationand skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only twofantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally.Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally wellunder the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro.A must see !Heat is a masterful cops and robbers tale that shows both sides of the lawin exquisite detail.  Strong performances by Pacino and DeNiro (the sceneofthem sitting across the table from each other is possibly 5 of the mostmemorable minutes in film history).  Excellent cinematography and perhapsthe best gunfight (if not, one of the most intense) since Hard Boiled.Morethan worth the 3 or so hours."	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Jack Nicholson really shinesthrough in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits thecharacter... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it,perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, thathe'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film anddiscovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon aspossible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what Iwould have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, itwas flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting andinvolving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more thanacceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting.The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines throughand really takes this character and makes him his own. The charactersare well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done andstill hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written andmemorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. Thecinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot,Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. Iliked that there was often something subtle going on in the background,while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanskicertainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, hemanages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and thereis fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. Thefilm has a few twists that are quite good, and they come assurprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyonewould be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be thatimpressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is agreat movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can takeit(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there'snot that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyonewho enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in arole that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski'sdirection and just a good movie with a more adult tone that manyothers. 10/10A film about LA and water set in the l930's during a drought with adark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by Faye Dunawayand Jack Nicholson, and superb cinematography that seemed to capturethe essence of LA. Directed by Roman Polanski, who makes a terrificcameo appearance as a switchblade wielding heavy, and using theconsiderable acting talents of John Huston as a ruthless and pervertedlandowner. Read Cadillac Desert to know about LA's water grab but seeChinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption, bothpublic and private. The direction, the screenplay, the acting, thephotography, and the soundtrack combine to make a convincing andatmospheric picture. The crushing ending is just so much more icing onthe cake.	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It was just so depressing andsadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...whywhy why did she have to keep touching things after she was told overand over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I wasdreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar filmsshould stick to what they are good at and that's making children (andadults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but thegeneral overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside anotherdepressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never havebeen made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can neverget back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry.talk about lack luster in this movie and lack of joy , i had to endurewatching this movie which had an awful plot , about some little girlwith emotional center something goes screwy and she gets depressed andalmost leaves home only to learn crying is good at the end . like howdoes that appeal to everyone ? talk about boring .The animated designfor the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff togetheryou had so many classic movies that would make this look like a pieceof crap e.g wall-e , Up , incredible , monster inc, monsters university, brave, toy story1-3, ratatouille etc . Please bring those kinds ofmovies with great plot and fire the writers and director who wrote thismovie . they should never set foot in the pixar company EVER!!There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why Ifind it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when SpiritedAway--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6.Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult tolike. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and theother emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and findeasy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me thewrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that wereused and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Rileyhas an ""imaginary boyfriend"" at the age of 12. I don't know about youpeople, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls shouldNOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while itmay start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexualthoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous attheir age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself)who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don'teven get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG!That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly,disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVEthis movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, onthe whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixarmovies. It was compared to ""UP"" for Pete's sake--the movie that hadEVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let-down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me tobuild it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watchat your own peril. Consider yourself warned.This movie was just disgusting. First off, there are so many otherterrible review giving this one star, and many people find thosereviews helpful. The movie only stars like 4 or 5 emotions in people'sheads, 4 or 5, I forgot, and frankly don't care since this movie wascomplete garbage. I ""watched"" this movie at a potluck at a friend'shouse but ended up playing ping pong with a friend the whole time sincethe movie failed to attract my attention. This movie is not suitablefor kids as well. I do not understand why it is on the IMDb top 250list, it should be on the bottom 100 list. This movie can scar kids andmake some people actually depressed. It is quite depressing that thereare such limited emotions and little activity in the brain expressed inthe movie. I was actually depressed after watching this movie and foundmyself in a bitter state lacking interest in activities I usuallycherish. Why? Because this stupid movie is trying to tell me what is inmy brain and is completely corrupting. I was emotionless after themovie just like how the movie is. I'm sure the disgust emotion in themovie would be disgusted at the movie.This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited tosee it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and notworth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave thismovie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for thismovie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on""reputable"" websites. The scores are overblown because people werebeing generous with negative scores and way too generous with positivereviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you wantto watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. Theemotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that fallsapart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of thismovie will remain."	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Atriumph from beginning to end, this film is pretty difficult topigeonhole as it has so many elements to it. Is it a thriller, is it areflection on one man's life, is it a buddy movie, is it a revengemovie? It's all this and more. It's got a great pace about it and thedepiction of city and country is nicely juxtaposed in many of it'sscenes. It's a while since I've seen this film, but there are so manyscenes which have stayed with me. I love this film, but damn it'sdifficult to find.I found this movie to be one of the best that have ever come out ofTurkey.It addresses and reflects on many levels issues and transformations thatarecurrently part of Turkish culture . Sener Sen is strong in his role as anaging ""eskiya"" (a Turkish word for a bandit that would roam the country,making his living off ambush and looting) who returns to his rural homeafter years of imprisonment only to find his only love taken away to thebigcity (Istanbul). The story unfolds as an at times romantic, at timesfunny,at times sad and serious tale which speaks to the multiplicities ofmodernTurkish life, be it the culture clash (and melding) between city andruralpopulace, institutional corruption, poverty, and most importantly theidentity of a nation that has for almost a century been torn between Eastand West. The love story driving the whole plot is really only a lighterframework to depict the more important issues in Turkish society thatthismovie successfully tackles.This is a great Turkish movie. It has a great story line. This movieopeneda new age in turkish movie history. Before this movie turkish cinemaswerealmost dying. The actors are great. If you want to watch a great movietrythis!Sener Sen was a well known actor before Eskiya but after this movie heis like Al Pacino for Turkish people.The movie is the best movie of allTurkish movies and I had seen it for nearly ten times and each time Idiscovered different things and I liked it more.The movie is about aneshkiya means a person lives in the mountains,takes money from richpeople in order to survive someone lawless.After 35 years in prison hemeets a man in the train and than their fates go in the same way.Hewill love him as if like his child so that he will even leave hisdarling for him.The movie is about love,revenge,mafia and drug deals.Itis a real masterpiece and I recommend this to everyonei can write just one comment about this movie. You must see that moviebefore you die. Magnificent movie from Turkey.

Ilove this film, but damn it's difficult to find."" i am join in that.And, to tell the truth, HE still is. The filmmakers in Turkey are alwaysclaiming about reaching the thing, the unbelievable, the extreme thing thatthis movie made to the people. With no grand advertising, or big budget,that's just a miracle that movie has made. And to a miracle, points orcomments do nothing but you wanted and I give:eternity out of 10 and justlove, like the movie gives to you.Yavuz Turgut's ""Eskiya,"" which came out almost a decade ago, is heperfect illustration of how unique Turkish cinema can be when itcombines elements of Western crime genre films and Anatolian folkdramas, which have been the basis for Turkish films since MuhsinErtugrul directed films some 75 years ago. The film has some majorflaws, but these are mostly in terms of production. The script and its'direction are fairly crisp, and the acting by veteran comic Sener Sen,in a serious role here, and Ugur Yucel, who was also great in AliOzgenturk's ""Balalayka,"" is quite exceptional. The film features ahaunting score, deep symbolism (particularly in the final scenes) andtimely social themes. I think the later is one of the reasons why ithas not been popular with those who are more unfamiliar with Turkey,but it is this very element which makes the film more than just aroutine gangster film. The film is also considerably more violent thanmost Turkish films, though many (particularly '70s films of the lateYilmaz Guney) made for brutal cinematic experiences. Anotherinteresting aspect of this film is that it shows a crime family takingits' lifestyle from Anatolia into Istanbul, which reminded me of howMarlon Brando took up where he left off upon leaving Sicily for NewYork. ""Eskiya/The Bandit"" is not as exceptional as either ""Yol"" or""Uzak/Distant"" but it is quite a moving film and I gather since itoutgroosed ""Titanic"" in Turkey, it was quite the crowd-pleaser.The filmwas also made at a time when film production in Turkey was at anall-time low, but the industry has thankfully picked up considerably."	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

He spoke very passionately about thefilm, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has createdsomething very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyoneshould see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez asCaptain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquerodelivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type ofperson who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not openuntil 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I amlooking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special EditionDVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review onhere. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen.I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it'sone of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever).Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderfulfairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances aregreat, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation ofthe film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the contextof the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), theSpanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernaturalinvading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocenceof children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" ismost compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhapsit's the most personal movie from Del Toro.It is Guillermo del Toro's best film ( 22 minutes ovation at Cannes).Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from allinvolved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist armycaptain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) asthe Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find isIvana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives oneof the best performances from a child actor we have seen since HaleyJoel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Come to it unprepared and with yourmind wide open and you will be rewarded with one of the best films ofthe year."""	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Itis an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even adetective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the lastmonths of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to givea meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind ofgovernment bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As aparable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is setpretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot ofcharacter, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyondthe strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance byTakashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his charactersuch a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second ofWatanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelminglysentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even manyhardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably,because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for afilm to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to seethis and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...""Ikiru"" is supposedly one of Steven Spielberg's favourite films, and one cansee the influence it's had on him not only in the sentimentality and theultimate ""feelgood factor"" (which may be a little too extreme for someviewers, although the script never condescends), but visually, especially inthe virtuoso sequence in which a reprobate leads our hero, a respectable anddull civil servant, on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo's frenzied nightlife - amasterpiece of camera placement and editing. With images throughout thatwill stay with you for a long time, and a terrific supporting performance byMiki Odagiri as a vivacious young ""office lady"", ""Ikiru"" is still anabsolute knockout more than 50 years on.

Thank God! It's simply a great filmfor all ages. Don't mind if the soundtrack isn't dubbed to your nativelanguage, my kids (4 and 6 years old) could easily follow the storywith just a few helpers. Japanese is a wonderful language. The film hasgreat direction, beautiful backgrounds and a mystical, pleasant aurathroughout. There's nothing like this, I promise you. It's idyllic, forthe most part, but still with an exciting story that unfolds intosomething very unexpected.I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translatingfor me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so manywonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids arefascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Leethought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumpingscenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I alsolove the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) whichpervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula whichalways involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a filmabout the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incrediblewhich adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any ageas well. Enjoy.I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work and was rather disappointed thatthis movie did not have the Japanese language/English subtitles option.But, I've finally seen it and must admit that it is incredibly cute.One does NOT have to be a child to enjoy this movie or any ofMiyazaki's movies. The story line was good and and the characters werereally touching. The totoros were so adorable that I want a plushie ofone. I also loved the artwork. I finally know what some of the scenesare from in the AMVs that I've seen. I would definitely recommend thisto families as well as to those who are Miyazaki fans. A definitethumbs up. Though I do wonder where Miyazaki gets some of the ideas forhis characters such as that cat bus.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I'm just at a lossfor words and struggling to describe how truly powerful andheart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if youdon't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (orwhile) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson)and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. Thebeauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universallyrelatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep,deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears;sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. Itmade me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always hadmy eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I waswitnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told andone of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to readmuch/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitelycatch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved(in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 Hands down thebest film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')Insert all 9 & 10 reviews here I was in awe during the entire film.Lenny Abrahamson & the writing team made sure there was not one dullmoment. The addition of ""insignificant"" characters and plot twists arelater realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the filmalive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made thisstory one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entirepalette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level ofcuriosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue toinfluence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the mostbeautiful way."	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Ina world of cruelty, Kurasowa has shown how the moments within the horror canhave beauty.Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do nothave to be kings and princesses to identify with the father's desire for thewell being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty andpain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran hasdone is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain torealize the beauty.Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve hismadness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the smallhouse of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister heforcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intensefocus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizesthat he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is nodialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of themusic.As with many of Kurasowa's films, despite their epic scope, it is the smallpaint strokes that make up the master's canvas.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

One cannothelp but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this wasthe film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It isa masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genresseamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like allgreat movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorablemoments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rollsto the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenesare brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was amaster of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physicalcomedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not justthree fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a briskpace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector(Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big bydiscovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, theprospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wantedcriminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold.Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big JimMcKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich.But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in themiddle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls inlove with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Ofcourse, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in thisbeauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who isnot content with every other woman in town by his side; he must haveGeorgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointedprospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be toomuch for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with hisuncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bringus one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie, I am a fanof Charlie Chaplin's movies, but as objective as I can possibly be,this IS one of the great movies...Essential viewing!Charles Chaplin's ""The Gold Rush"" is arguably his finest film. He stars as awimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of strikingit rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form ofGeorgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him.""The Gold Rush"" shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the greatperformer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematicicon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying wantto entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. Themovie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed withmovies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would stillprobably call ""The Gold Rush"" the finest film of that 10-year period. Oh howthe cinema misses Charles Chaplin today. 5 stars out of5.In Charles Chaplin's 1925 film, ""The Gold Rush"", a lone prospectortravels to California looking for gold, and entwines himself inadventures and finds Georgia, the woman of his dreams. After manyhardships, including a relocating cabin, the lone prospector, played byCharles Chaplin, finds gold and becomes rich, ending in success andunity with Georgia. The time period in which this movie was shot,compared with the technological innovation and the state of the artfilming techniques, give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel. Theuse of up-close shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a newfeel to the style of silent cinema. The scene with the cabin shifting,and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin, was one of the manystylistic filming techniques that gave ""The Gold Rush"" such artisticand ingenious appeal. Chaplin's ideas and his vision that he brought tolife in the movie ""The Gold Rush"" make it a great landmark in thebeginning of silent films and in film history. The intricate but simplestory of ""The Gold Rush"" brought about many distinct feelings whenviewing. It gives feelings of happiness, during scenes where there iscomedic relief and slapstick comedy, and also can bring about sadnessor pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Year'sbut she never shows up. It reveals how silent films can become in touchwith a person's feelings, making them feel for the protagonist, withouthaving to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot. These aspectsof ""The Gold Rush"" make it a milestone in the film industry of themodern world.One of the best Chaplin movies, which means one of the best movies evermade. Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as`Eatingthe shoe' and `The Roll Dance'. Both the original version and the secondrelease have their own charm."	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get toknow the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting andcinematography.  Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the singleminded Colonel Nicholson.  The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito'shut is remarkable.  Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takesoffense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongsidethe enlisted men.  Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of hispunishment, and it drives him crazy.  The film's plot has two stories thatare beautifully intertwined.  Shears' return to the bridge is his only wayto escape the bridge.  In the film's final act, the tension is turned up asthe British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only thendoes Nicholson realise what the bridge really is.  The Bridge on the RiverKwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that isLawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.  Onedirector who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Capra, fresh off amazing successes like ""Lady for a Day"", ""ItHappened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""Lost Horizon"" and ""You Can'tTake It With You"", used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with apowerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlashby publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience.As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is amasterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Whoshould be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullibleJames Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will beeasy to manipulate and he won't rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of theBoy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided bymany high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees HarryCarey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys'camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beatthose in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (anever-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid asalways here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunknewspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) areall terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptivelyintelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama andinterpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderfulAmerican film experiences. 5 stars out of 5. Mr. Smith is as good as it's legend. Sometimes I'm disappointed when auniversally acclaimed movie isn't as enjoyable as I thought it wouldbe.But here, that is not the case. James Stewart is deservedly remembered mostfor this role. That's saying a lot given his impressive body of work. Thisis also Frank Capra's signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism ofJefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but, and I know this isa cliché, the world could use more people with his values. The supportingcast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr.Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Stronglyrecommended, 9/10."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

One that fills your entirearray of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentinereviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in anothermajestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercelyaffected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy thatdominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensualbut never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, theinvestigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. Theconnection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannoteasily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-languagefilm of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece.The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, andthe comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balledout for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms ofcomic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from GuillermoFrancella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact thesecondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive,especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups,and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as itscandidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it.Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all,I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Takinginto account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, itcame out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because ofthe rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funnymoments and especially an incredibly faithful description of theArgentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. Thislast element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all thetime -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to suchextent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employedto achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fullyunderstand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway theywill surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enoughfor them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matterhow incredible they might look.I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I haveseen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!.This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks tothe excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basicallyexplores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (onvarious areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense,a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""TheAura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerfulin the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (thetop, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards(Oscar included), because it deserves so!).Wow what a great movie really! It began like a simple crime story butthe wonderful use of subjects, symbols and strong references turned itin to a masterpiece. Details about Eva Peron's Argentina andquestioning of the terms of law and justice. My interest is increasingfor Latin American Cinema when I watch such beautiful works. By the wayI watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles weretranslated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" whichsucks. But I had to use it cause there was not any subtitle in mynative language yet. Despite all these problems, it was so impressive.You shall see it at once!"	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Blade Runner (either version) stands the test oftime as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as wellas the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently(to varying degrees of success) since its original release. Theinterplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the mostphilosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of themodern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even inthe face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut,contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify manyof the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film evenbetter, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a newgeneration of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously lessidealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of theoriginal. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny andmeandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding andfits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for manyreasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a truestatement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, andequally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I wouldsuggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt,Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophersafter viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its conceptsat a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece offilm-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertainand promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It's one ofthose classics like 'Citizen Kane', 'Rear Window' or 'The Godfather' thathas subtlety entered popular culture, so even if you haven't actually seenit you recognize references to it in other movies, TV, magazines andeveryday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and 'Rashomon'and 'Sunset Blvd' it isn't regarded as a masterpiece for nothing, it reallyis one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by 'TheSeventh Seal'. It's still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made.Visually it's stunning, the acting is first rate, and the end result ismesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche, but it's the perfectdescription for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays AntoniusBlock, a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death (BengtEkerot) to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by hiscynical squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Jons is my favourite character inthe movie, and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand's performance is evenbetter. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part ofBlock's entourage, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), andconfess to developing quite a crush on Mia. I cannot recommend 'The SeventhSeal' highly enough. Don't be put off by Bergman's highbrow reputation, thisis a movie that can be appreciated by anybody, especially by old schoolhorror fans. While it isn't strictly a horror movie itself anyone whoadmires the James Whale and Val Lewton classics of the 1930s and 1940s willfind much to enjoy here.	A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence,Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama thatis every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically.  In theFourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire,Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at theCrusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home.  ForBlock, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God'ssilence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well asa resolution of faith, which has deserted him.  Jons, meanwhile, is a studyin jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present andwhatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after theirarrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block.  ButBlock strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to beplayed as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails,they will go on; if he wins, he will be released.  And though Block knowswhat the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of hischallenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill hisquest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through aland being ravaged by the Black Plague.	Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his verycountenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle, stoic approach tothis enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity thatmakes Block truly memorable.  By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of hisindifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhatfatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteranof numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons thatplays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block.  Itis significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presenceof Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a stationequal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block.	The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), IngaGill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell(Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat).  Written and directed by Bergman, `TheSeventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith andmortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images thatwill forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene inparticular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against atwilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill,is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) asan example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in thehistory of the cinema.  I rate this one 10/10.           What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable ofmedieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergmancreates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can playchess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, andplague ever present. Through superb black and white images, eachcarefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fineactors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow,Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its notall doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, themeaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheerhappiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberriesat dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Whichbalances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still rememberseeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of thephotography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD isrecommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time.Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on thescreen. Not to be missed."	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is one of the most intelligently written stories I've everseen.  If you like to write screenplays, let this one take you for a spin.Very fast paced film with great editing techniques and a hilarious cast andstoryline thats sure to entertain, as long as you can handle the accents.Great cinematography as well.  This story will send you through a corkscrew.  See it once, then see it again to see what you missed.Best comedy in years, friend turned me on to this hilarious comedy of errorsand glad she did. The film is damn near flawless, forces you to payattention to the twists and turns through it's witty dialogue. Wonderfullyphotographed with brilliant camerawork but not overdone. Worth severalsittings and we could learn alot in Hollywood from this one....You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screeningin London, and afterwards said, ""This movie rocks.""  Whatever you may thinkof Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I hadtrouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchiemanaged to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested andcompelled to watch.  I also didn't have any trouble understanding what thecharacters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films likethis by saying, ""Oh, I can't understand them"" lack patience.  I also likedall the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one ofmy few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actualviolence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but alot of fun.If this film had been dubbed for American viewers, (even if it would havelost the magic of the cockney accent), not one person from the States wouldhave said this wasn't a really good film. I didn't even understand most ofthe dialogues, but the weirdness of the characters and of what they did wasreally funny.  Not hysterically funny, but Funny! The mixture of comedy andviolence was the thing that most amused me.  The story itself isn't of themost original, but surely efficacious. The photography and the soundtrackwere also brilliant and to finish, I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved it, but afterseeing LS&2SM I was too busy thinking over and over how much I liked it fornoticing a whatsoever similarity with PF. 10 out of 10 is a bit too muchbut  9/10 definitely isn't!

Along with Mean StreetsCasino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  Iwould also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film.The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphereandaccomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accuratelyportraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best ofanyfilm Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesciwould be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I sawCasino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all overagain.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of thetime period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless.Perhapsit is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becomingless satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films thatpossess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  SharonStone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editingisconcerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is notshot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort,collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius ofScorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understandingand appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levelsthatScorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casinoexemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  Thisfilm is truly a gem.  A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese'sCasinois a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so manychancesand succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that werefound in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - whileGoodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar""gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlledthoseguys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control theflow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris,and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition itdeserves in the years to come.Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsesedirected in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the scriptisexcellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesciischilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliantfilmMartin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece risesabove anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability andmeans to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeurand put into it as much effort as possible for people remember thosewho take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligentin their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's muchmore than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subjectof organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movieand those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst thegrey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others'accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personaluselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, inmy opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time.Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's alwayssomeone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if youscrew things up."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The language barriers and theconfinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simplymagnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out ofhis mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity.Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor andhis performance survived the test of time with the vigor of hisconviction.

And JudyGarland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart andgets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoicBurt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster andwith Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen ""Judgement AtNeuremberg"" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze methat no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages toentertain and inspire.I have always been fond of Stanley Kramer's work , but this movieproved to be quite extraordinary and exceptional .The movie has everything you can desire and human sentiments are at there level best. Theplot is written by Abby Mann who won best screenplay Oscar from thatand quite deserving one. The story based on Nuremberg trials held afterfall of Nazi's in Germany but this movie is nice blend of history withfiction as the major characters were fictional but the evidences andindictments presented in the trial ever authentic and truly depicts theconditions of Nazi occupied Germany. The most intriguing thing of themovie was the true representation of aftermaths of Nazi's occupation inGermany and the feeling of German toward the trial and immaculatedirection of Kramer made possible to convey these types of sentiment oncinema for the very first time. The cast was also fascinating with bignames like Tracy and surely he did justice with his role as he was verycompelling and humble as Judge Haywood. Maximilian Schell was at hisbest as a compassionate enthusiastic zealous and patriotic attorney todefend the dignity of Nation. He won best actor Oscar for his role.Montgomery Clift was also the one who made this movie special as heplayed a role of feeble minded sterile man who was nominated for bestactor in supporting role though he only played for 9 min in the movie.Burt Lancaster gave one of the most extraordinary cinematicperformances as Ernst Janning. This is one of those movies whichprovokes our mentality and also our morality and is a treat to watch."	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A trip and a form of catharsis.It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, abouta marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is amirror. The same crisis is the ""gift"" of everybody. The same silence,fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American orIrakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past likeonly reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye.It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books,some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of ourhours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smileare the trees of their presence. Isak Borg is the image of a age. Ourage who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only way tobe yourself. The way to Lund, the relation with Agda, the emptyattitude, the projection in Evald, the words are the symbols of a clockwho is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only reality of our life.Wild Strawberries can be praised for so many reasons, but chief among themin my own mind is the way in which the film so perfectly conveys its themesof self-examination and the contemplation of one's own mortality(particularly through its stunning use of flashbacks).  Bergman'sautobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedishfilm legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance isessential to the success of Wild Strawberries.  I read that Bergman basedthe coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and itnever ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all theseyears.  Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepectivemovie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema's most impressive motionpictures.  Quite simply one of the very, very best movies I have ever seen.  Saw itrecently for the second time, some 15 to 20 years after seeing it for thefirst time.  First time round I was the age and stage of the travelingyoungsters and saw the world through their eyes.  This time I couldidentifymore with the son and daughter-in-law characters with just as muchconviction.  The subtlety and sophistication of this movie defydescription.It simply has to be seen to be believed.

The innovativecamera-angles, the close-ups revealing pain and spirituality. It elevatesthe human condition and the Art of film. I would love to be able to go oninto the whys or hows or technicalities. But my words couldn't do the filmjustice for the imagery still overwhelms me. A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for thegenius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, useof incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributedto Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason thisfilm indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form ofbrilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One cannot help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift tous of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should beacknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenesto produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in thistimeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have beenconsidered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by thesilent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the heador gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak inJeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguishwhich the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we arewatching what the director said he had found; the martyr'sreincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred bypowders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet thefact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet cannot help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'LaPassion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudiblesighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee MariaFalconetti's Jeanne.One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound,Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, rivetingportrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the originaltrial.  Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations thatdoomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups toaccentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the mostgrotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti isunforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, andsaintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles anactor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning atthe stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motifbalancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality. This is the most fabulous movie I have ever seen.I like old and silentmovies, but I was completely blown away with this movie. It is unlike anythat you have ever seen.Joan's acting is the BEST I have ever seen. It is sosuperior to anything being made today. One does not need special effects andcomputers  to make a great movie.And if any movie deserves that title thisone does.I couldn't praise it enough. The direction and camera work isperfection. The way it is filmed with mostly head shots and faces you wouldthink it would be boring.But it is the most alive movie I have ever seen andprobably ever made.You cannot take your eyes off of Joan. She ismesmerizing.	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during theVictorianAge, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (JohnHurt),an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as'TheElephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynchgrasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionallycapturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is thefact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional.Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat savesJohnfrom those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A storyof human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The ElephantMan.Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with adark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film isamazingand would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white addsto the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much morepersonal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast,`David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as oneofthe best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintainsthatfreaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they`challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed andsexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this veryinteresting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values inregard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tensionand curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a humanbeing! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible andit ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity andemotion.David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The ElephantMan is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views JohnMerrickas not the average person because of his medical condition, the story ischerished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to hisother films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is moresurreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent jobin portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along withcritics alike agree.I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynchdeserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking anddevastatingfilm depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified andnormal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search ofawonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves'account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, butalsotakes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life isfull because I know I am loved.'With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film thatshould be loved by many, if not all.There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outerappearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some ofthese films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best.This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeedson every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey,industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come todiscover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused andunfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence.The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create thisextraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get insidethis man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the mosteffective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a filmfind a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingeringfascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is itchanges the way people see themselves, other people and the world. Ican still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over theaudience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the bigscreen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to readthe many other user comments to see how people were moved and changedby this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

This could have beenanunbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, thedirectorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience toaccompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone whohasbeen close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate howrespectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard isableto portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintainingthehumanity and dignity of the patient.

I am in complete shock over theperformances in this film. Nick Nolte, as usual, gives a gritty, gutwrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees.One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. Nolte was Rich Man, Poor Man,absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. Hardy and Mr.Edgeron were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them byfar! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could notwait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie thatcertainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod forNick Nolte, and if it were up to me, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron wouldwalk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop whatyou are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly whatbeing a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!OK, Lets talk about the the big pink elephant in the room first. Yes,the movie has a similar storyline from movies of the past. And yes, itmay be, to some, ""just another fight movie. However, Warrior has theaudacity to challenge the cliché's and still manages to stand out fromthe rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotionalroller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a starstudded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid andbelievable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his roleand will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will betorn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of thisentertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional powerconnected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Gosee this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret notsupporting what is sure to be a classic!I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since itsa ""guy"" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was.I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film.It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of myseat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. Ifyou are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenesthan this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn'tstop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comesout. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husbandI think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was duringMarley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!The official trailer itself is a little bit of a spoiler. I didn't evenhave an IMDb account and made one just to rate this movie. One of thebest iv ever seen. First movie iv ever cried during, and i cried twicelol. Whether your a guy who likes fighting movies or a girl who doesn'tknow what MMA stands for, this movie will blow you away. Seriously, Idon't know how anyone could watch this and think it wasn't at the veryleast, a Very Good movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and itsalso more realistic the most fighting movies. Watching rocky and mostbox office fighting films, there tends to be over-dramatized punchingnoises and the boxers seem to fight without attempting to guardthemselves. Aside from the realistic fight however, is a very emotionaldrama which is sure to move anyone who pays attention to the film."	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Sunrise, to me, is the definitive moment in silentcinema.  Not only is sound unnecessary, but so are words -- indeed, thereare remarkably few title cards.  Instead, Murnau trusts in the ability ofhis images to convey his story; he doesn't need words.  The story itself issimple, archetypal.  It functions primarily as a frame onto which Murnaufastens scene after scene of breathtaking splendor.  In particular, thefirst shots of the City are dizzyingly complex and layered.  Additionally,it's impossible to come away unimpressed by the Storm which tosses thecharacters during their return journey.  Murnau is one of the fewfilmmakers, and perhaps the first, to truly embrace the possibilities offilm as its own medium, rather than as a novelty or, alternatively, aconvenient way to preserve a stage play.  Though he is better remembered forother films, most particularly Nosferatu, Sunrise is his crowningachievement.I have no words. This is cinema. This is not a story, this is not aplot. This is THE STORY, this is THE PLOT. Murnau can describe thehuman beings, the men, the women and the fast blind society. The womanof the city seems to be a post-modern nosferatu. She is a vampire, shemoves like Dracula, she is like a witch around a tree. This film holdsthe tragedy and the comedy, the laughing and the crying. ""Sunrise""doesn't belong to the past, but It belongs to the story, to the time.Sunrise, yes...the sunrise of the modern cinema waiting for ""CitizenKane"".I found this movie at the library the other day and I had to rent it afterbeing aware for the longest time that it's the highest film on the Sight &Sound list that I have not seen yet. After seeing it, can I say that itdeserves its honor?  I would say so, it's the polar opposite of modern filmand that gets my interest since it reveals so much that cinema has gainedand lost in 75 years. It tells a simple story while getting the most out ofmy reactionas opposed to movies that utilize technology, over character andstory development, even though this is a movie that has time to be showy andflashy with its beautiful city sequences. After seeing Abel Gance'sNapoleon, a film from the same era, I would consider this movie on par forits technical angle, which I think is half the selling point for thecritic's circles. It employs a magic realism that you will not find in anymodern film today, a movie where you don't care if it takes them a minute totravel from the forest to the city."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had begunto think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance mayhave been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies evermade). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening,and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completelyblown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, Irelated (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLYbelieved every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay anda delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should getScorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for themovie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creationof this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true)story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulledout all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank youMr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Its really that good folks.And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is nothing but spectacular.Watch this movie :-).OK, I only went to see this because of the Wachowski brothersinvolvement. I went totally expecting to hate this movie about aterrorist but it was so much more. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME!While not an action picture there's plenty of action and at least onefunny homage to The Matrix. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring,believe it or not and it didn't make me want to blow up buildingseither. It just made me appreciate freedom even more. Hugo Weaving isterrific and Natalie Portman leaves Princess Amadala far behind withher performance as Evey. Everyone's great. Stephen Rea is terrifictoo. I just can't believe I liked this movie. I'm still in shock....I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, andgiven the nature of my comment those retorts may very well beresoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Bestfilms I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response wouldbe, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy.""Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has beensomething up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter toleave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity toinspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could neverbe, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things goingin the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film,yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough inthis time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endurebut seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that donot matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly,the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodicalerosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react withcomplete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from therest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just likeeveryone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films likethis, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in theworld, all we want to do is play our video games, watch realitytelevision, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Thingsthat for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are thedistractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of thenight what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committedby those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema candazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one thatI will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message findsa wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective,in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film isabout...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not torecognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things betterthan they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but forthe viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from thisartificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I seethere is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can tomake it right.""

Clint Eastwood will have youlaughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same timebreaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you ona roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applauseafterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't getnominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I sawwas held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA,DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know theirmovies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear,and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from peoplecrying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwoodreally creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again!With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, JackNicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. ThoughEastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a moviewith his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"".Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies likeAbsolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, causedEastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material towork with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good asever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think ofthat old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open,the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or buildingsomething. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because thescenes between himself and the various Hmong characters wherepriceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes,but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talkor act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going togive the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosedtough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge,you'll love this movie!!This is a poignant, beautiful movie, maybe the best film Eastwood hasever done. The characters are fully drawn, believable, and resonatetrue human emotion. I at first was put off by the idea of seeing amovie about an old racist, but when I saw the numbers of peopleattending the screenings, I thought there must be something there, so Iwent to the Arclight in Hollywood, where the theater was packed. Crustyold Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, now living in run down Detroit,hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him. Astime goes on, he gets to know them, and the bond that forms iswonderful, and spiritual. There was not a dry eye in the house when themovie ended. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say thisis a truly wonderful story, one that you will love and tell yourfriends to see. If you're looking for one of those great movieexperiences that so rarely comes along, you'll not find a better filmto see than this.Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well asdirecting he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski arecently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism andbitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives inalone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they wantsomething and his grandkids have already started deciding what theywill have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in thepub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun byimmigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmongfamily with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prizecar, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reformthe boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture andchange his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where youbegin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns thatwill test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it'sa real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt thatsteals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising whichmeans that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At timesit plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver'but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, somethingthat Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context andyou have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that goodand it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned withwhen it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of'Grand Torino' both.This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with bothgrimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Goodacting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once againClint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves bothemotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's characterand the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticismof the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does notcorrespond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all aroundthe world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots ofpotential for being one of those films that you will actually rememberwhen you visit the video rental store in five years from now."	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sitdown in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on thesilver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequenceBusbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humoris rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correctarrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at)nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes thisfilm such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism,the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (JeffBridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendouslyendearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip SeymourHoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger,who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among otherthings), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life.And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer tothe worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, whatmore could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not tomention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the bestperformances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile,an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter,who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers havealways been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here butwarmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What wehave here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and ifyou can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, andfind your inner-Dude as soon as possible.My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch andrewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When Ifirst saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it butthought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many oftheir previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I havecome to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become oneof my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weavetogether various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic,postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethanand Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn'tshout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, andbottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most!Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, setdesign, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliantever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers,Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, CaptainBeefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course theactors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City','Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else actingthe role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, PeterStomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('BoogieNights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can'tfault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertainingcomedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this thatkeep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage thatHollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office TopTen was as inspired and amusing as this one!No movie has entertained me more in the last year thanthisfilm. It's delightfully written, directed with poise andacted with extravagance and excellence.I do admit that this is a film that I had to seesix times to get. Every time I watch it I learn somethingnew.The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers playwith their audiences. There are the touchesof the masters in many of their films. In ""The HudsuckerProxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""RaisingArizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, Ifeltmany touches of greatness, but more specifically I feltJohn Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camerawas manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of theirtalents lurking in at many a turn.The performances are astounding, especially Goodmanas the deranged bowler still living deep within the junglesof the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderfulas the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameoas ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous versionof the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol.I hope this is a film that is looked at with moreseriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece offilmmaking.  The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese,Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout theirirreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Theirbest stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was ferventlyfree.  I was so ever wrong.It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthroughsuccess (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever theyplease.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel,that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heavingfrom laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentriccharacters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies,even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (JeffBridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares,paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetentcriminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything, anything...  Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandioselydifferent.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressedin a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camerapans down to reveal his name as Jesus!  I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to yournearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon allsolemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilstwatching."	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not only is he a great actor, he always picks good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences from the war.It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel enough for these three basic people to get through the war.The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to die, making them all the more nervous.The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for the better.De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting, it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this tour-de-force.My rating: 10/10Rated R for strong language and violence.Outstanding and haunting Best Picture winner of 1978 that still packs apunch nearly 25 years later. Robert DeNiro (Oscar-nominated),Christopher Walken (Oscar-winning for Best Supporting Actor) and JohnSavage are on their way to fight for their country in Vietnam. Thethree are in for a rude awakening from their simple lives in a smallsteel town in Pennsylvania. The terrors of Vietnam will change all.DeNiro, an avid deer hunter, cannot stand to even shoot a gun after hereturns. Savage loses his legs and is too ashamed and scared to returnhome to his new wife and friends. Walken has lost it mentally and staysin Vietnam and develops the taste for Russian roulette. The movie is atrial to sit through in many ways, but it is also an important filmthat was the first commentary on the topic of Vietnam. Meryl Streepalso received her first of a record 12 Oscar nominations as Walken'slove interest. John Cazale was deathly ill during the making of themovie and died shortly after the film was completed of terminal cancer.Michael Cimino's amazing Oscar-nominated screenplay andout-of-this-world Oscar-winning direction are right on key. ""The DeerHunter"" is important film-making that has a strong message about life,death and love. It is a movie that should be experienced by everyone atleast once. 5 stars out of 5.I cannot fathom the absolute horror that war brings to a persons life,but never has a film depicted it more harrowing than The Deerhunter. At182 minutes, it seemed to fly by, leaving me wanting more and wishingthis would not end. all facets are explored, all people's emotions arelaid bare, not just the combatants. If we obviously did not knowbetter, one would have to say this was a British film, as it has allthe best elements that British movie making displays. i can eulogisefor hundreds of lines, but this really is the ONLY American movie i canthink of (others? apart from taxi driver) that is RAW. A strange word iknow but the movie oozes a raw edge to it. Immense performances fromall concerned, and if i had to say, i believe i have not seenChristopher Walken in a better role. One of the very few films ideservedly give 10/10. A must for any collection and a stunning exampleof every aspect of film making coming together, albeit for a sombredepiction of life.Those other negative comments that suggest that maybe this movie wasgood when it came out, but hasn't aged well, are dead wrong! I waitedin line to see it on Opening Night in 1978. As a Vietnam veteran and ahuge DeNiro fan, I was really looking forward to the first big movieabout Nam. And it was as hideous, boring, exploitive, senseless, andunrealistic that night as it is now! They're going to Nam the nextday?!? Without any kind of basic training or anything? The Walkencharacter survives how many years playing Russian roulette?? How doesDeNiro get away with that beard in Special Forces? I knew many soldiersfrom Western Pennsylvania steel mills, but not one with Walken'sblow-dried hair-do that not even New York dancers were wearing till thelate '70s! Okay, so let's suspend disbelief and not criticize its lackof anything vaguely realistic. In that case, we are left with a boring,long, boring, disjointed, boring, meaningless, exploitive piece of crapthat had nothing whatever to do with the Vietnam War. And did I mentionboring? For those who want a movie about the Vietnam War, I recommendApocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and a wonderfulalmost-unknown Burt Lancaster movie called Go Tell The Spartans thatalso came out in '78. Almost every Vietnam vet I know liked ApocalypseNow -- almost all thought The Deer Hunter was crap. And Cimino's latercareer supplies ample evidence for that point of view!"	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed. I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened. Follow the latchkey!Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore) look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.By the way, the ""original theatrical trailer"" preceding these Warner Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the ""Coming Attractions""--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You might want to fast forward to the movie itself."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible tome. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to lifemusthave been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph offilm-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations tocome.If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece, you'llbe swayed by the 65th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 4-disc set featuresthe remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch inone day (after watching the film, of course). The two-hour making-ofdocumentary is fascinating and shows how the producer (David O.Selznick) of the film affected the cast, director(s) and writer(s) --and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett. Thefeature of Olivia De Havilland (in 2004) discussing her role as Melanieis a real treat. The picture and sound are great on the 65thAnniversary DVD, and the special features are a true treasure. Acceptno substitutes, seek out the 65th Anniversary DVD and bring it home.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, inthat they both have characters we root for who create zany plans thanend up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seemto like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of theMinnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for itsbrilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William HMacy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of politicalcorrectness (how many movies can you remember when the only twominority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to drawattention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how wellthe music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scoredsuperbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance,notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?""in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediatelyplayed that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how youinterpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassingnumber of times and have committed its screenplay, from start tofinish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, abrilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he placesthis movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.""What'd this guy look like anyway?""""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""""Uh-huh. In what way?""""Just a general way.""In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen's finest film.Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper.Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing the interview!""Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you.With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny,wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"".  It's one of those filmsthat you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominatedperformance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one aknow-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap hiswife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father.Needlessto say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in anOscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything awaybecause the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen thisinventive film.  ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, thisfilm was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the1970ssuch a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It isvery well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into adeeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror moviesense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies thatgives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The musicis quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera workis usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had theenjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways betweenscenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. Iwas going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take anypoints from perfect.An instant classic. I must admit what attracted me at first was thewood chipper incident I had heard about but by the time the movie getsthere, I was in a totally in a different universe. While the movie doesnot have anything to keep you glued to the screen (a wicked script,lots of action) you can't prevent yourself from wanting to see whathappens next. This is due to the wonderfully portrayed characters.Steve Buscemi's performance as Carl Showalter is fabulous. I love whenhe is confronted by Shep Proudfoot and tells him to ""hey man, smoke afin peace-pipe"", or any of his conversations with Jerry Lundegardare priceless - ""I'm not going to debate you Jerry, I'm not going toDEBATE"". My recent favorite is when he storms out of the hideout andsays ""and if you see Shep Proudfoot, tell him I'm gonna nail hisfkin ass"". The Jerry Lundegard character is such a beautiful loser,I don't know where to begin. I especially love his reappearing tempertantrums(slamming the phone book in his office, scraping the ice offthe windshield, jumping up and down after his father in law leaves thehouse with the million dollars) and practicing the phone call to hisfather in law where he tells him his wife has been kidnapped - toofunny. Marge Gunderson is the glue that holds it all together with aperformance by Frances Mcdormand well deserved of an Oscar. I thoughtthey might have overdid it a tiny bit with the scene with Marge and thetwo hookers (too many ""Ya's"" in it) but otherwise a wonderful,refreshing character in the middle of a bunch of losers. Her characteris so honest and persistent, it makes me wonder why I cant find a womanlike that - and then I realize, I'm watching a movie and a brilliantone at that.With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages.  The story is well thought out.  The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality.  The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent.  Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across.  Every film course should make use of this movie to demonstrate how to make a very good film without relying on a bottomless budget.Nobody seems to know that Fargo is first and foremost a beautiful andvery simple love story about two ordinary rural small town Americanpeople and secondly a superbly acted crime murder mayhem movie,probably the best that has ever been filmed. Every character isgenuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rollsin and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built inare amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance -stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an AmericanShakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seenFargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them.Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. Ieven sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there,it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end. Fargo is asclose to capturing and portraying real life as a director and bunch ofactors can get. I wish IMDb had a just one time eleven so I could crownit emperor above all.This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found ""The Big Lebowski"" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as being the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", could be proving their peak creativity is behind them.""Fargo"" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this out - 8.2 for ""Fargo"", 8.0 for ""Lebowski"", and 7.8 for ""Brother"". For sheer entertainment, ""Lebowski"" or should I call it, ""The Dude"" wins handsdown, but ""Fargo"" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence. Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again.And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose around her. She knows all-to-well that ""you know what"" happens, but always knows ""you know what"" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations.I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing. Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever.

It's a masterpiece in my opinion, full ofsuspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It's also one of the mostromantic movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times over theyears, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quiteshocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of thereasons it really works is the flawless casting. I'm not much of an Olivierfan but he's superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm andcoldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter's new bride. Ican't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine anyother actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion'with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a muchstronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliantperformances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepyMrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and NigelBruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy.Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent',and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal ""Beaky"" in 'Suspicion'. Isometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many becausethey are regarded as being too ""old fashioned"", but for me movies like'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the mostentertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of thelot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch'Rebecca'!In a line-up of great motion pictures, ""Rebecca"" stands as one of thegiants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort, replete withjolting, slap-in-the-face plot twists and gothic sets. Dark and moody, thefilm boasts Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine in slam-dunk, dead onperformances, George Sanders as the deliciously despicable Jack Favell,andJudith Anderson nearly stealing the show as the eerie, obsessedhousekeeper,Mrs. Danvers. A perfect ""10"".The only Alfred Hitchcock (Oscar-nominated for directing) film to win theBest Picture Oscar, ""Rebecca"" is one of those typical films from the amazingdirector that chills, entertains and puts you on the edge of your seat eachtime you watch it. Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the verywealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by hismysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance byJudith Anderson) and the memory of the film's titled character (Olivier'slate wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in filmsspares none of that here as Anderson's character and the late titledcharacter's relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer.Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she mayaccomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock's first real major U.S. debut stunnedthe Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best PictureOscar. It is not the best film the legendary director ever worked on, but itis still an amazingly good production that works on many cinematic levels.4.5 out of 5 stars. A stylishly directed and photographed film that examines a number ofthemes, such a deception, death and depression, and explores well theemotions of its characters. It is rare to find a film like this, as ittackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to adrama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious.The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quietbut sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in livelybut also sinister performance. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine areperfect for their roles too. The film won Academy Awards for BestPicture and Best Cinematography quite deservingly  this is one of thebest films Hollywood has ever produced."	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the humanspirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman'sfinest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in ""The Hustler"" and FrankGalvin in ""The Verdict""; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopiaof acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke asChrist becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of theegg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as ifcrucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt,however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, andfully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is alsofascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors suchas Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and WayneRogers - who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie canunquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started(11/2000) showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it inall its glory. Amazing movie....watched it for the first time three or four years ago.Seen it plenty of times since......this, along with ""One Flew over theCuckoo's Nest"", is one of my favorite films of all-time. Luke is atruly memorable character; funny, tragic, inspirational.....a lot likeRandle Patrick McMurphy. Paul Newman once again proved the Academy tobe full of idiots, giving a great performance deserving of an Oscar.How he only won once, when Sally Field is the owner of two statuettes,is inexplicable. His run of classic films and touchstone charactersfrom the 60s-70s (Luke, Fast Eddie, Butch, etc) is unparalleled. GeorgeKennedy was good, too......I mightn't be good at critiquing, but I knowwhat I like. And I like this.Now that it has become sort of fashionable to speak or write badly about thefilms of the 60s and 70s, saying that people stopped going to the movietheatres during that fruitful period (which is not true), we must -more thanever-rate a flick as ""Cool Hand Luke"" as it really deserves. The rebelspirit of the lead character (played to perfection by the excellent PaulNewman) against that brutal and -most of the times- unfair ""establishment""represented by the prison guards is a subject that remains as topical asever. If this picture had been made today, it could also probably be good,but it would undoubtedly be much more unpleasant and filled with four-letterwords. Besides, who could match the performances of Newman, George Kennedy(the deservedly Oscar-winner who has kept on making a brilliant career -doyou remember him as ""The Blue Knight""?), Strother Martin, J.D.Cannon, etc.?Jo Van Fleet´s character as Luke´s mother seems a sort of slightly-agedversion of her role as James Dean´s mum in ""East Of Eden"", and it is reallyworthwhile. The scene of the hard-boiled eggs is a classic and a gem, but myfavourite scene in the movie is that of the car-washing girl so wonderfullyplayed by Joy Harmon (who is really a Joy for any man´s eyes); thatcharacter truly says a lot of things without speaking -her gorgeous bodyspeaks for her! I must say that it´s not only one of the sexiest scenes I´veever seen in a film but also a very significative one: there is an enormouscontrast between the image of the lass moving and shaking in complete andabsolute freedom (even in her way of dressing) and the imprisonedmen-at-work who watch her as something extremely desirable but, alas,completely out of reach. (The viewer can really feel like a prisoner too!).All in all, this is a fine film of the 60s, but also of the 70s, the 80s,the 90s, the 21st century and whatever God wants it to come.

And what aexperience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describeshis world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in thecharacters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommonmovie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technicalaspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as muchfor a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life.This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is amasterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It haslayers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to trainyour Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there ismore to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what imean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship,prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss thismovie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE.Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see thismovie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should trulybelong there. 10/10.Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon. This is thebest movie I've seen since the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Virtuallyeverything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to ananimated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a greatstory, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive andconstructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon.This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feelgood movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulationsto all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons apopular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it's best."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasionswhere everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior toAlien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's notonly about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create aparanoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that isworshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste infilms.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with elements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure.2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are: Hispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and of itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then the story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she said, ""For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be built around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood routinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force Awakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood."" This means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie is in the user reviews here at IMDb3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his nephew is the new Darth Vader4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars. Jedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be strong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a trained Sith lord, etc.WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONEThere are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have made Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years, they could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a Sith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark side. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find Luke's severed hand with a light saber in it.To me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the Republic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order are the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they could have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the weanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles with the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished (after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have grown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who looked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no intention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would be the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what. However, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and touching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then they still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was turning to the dark side.Any of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight. It's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can 1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented writers, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply amounts to lazy writing and oversight.CONCLUSIONBecause everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of what we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood can continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then wonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate movies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply support overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to make a political statement at the expense of entertainment.I'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX, because I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX will be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with Ren as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure VIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren saying, ""Ren, I am your cousin,"" and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey to the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops and the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene. Yeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or time to do it again.Star Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct whackos. Thanks a lot!A NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWSAfter reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the conclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who will rave about anything with the ""Star Wars"" logo attached to it and will refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie, 1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off because it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by studio hacks.The positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative reviewers ""Haters."" It's amazing how convenient it is today for people to throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing opinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the character and honesty of the positives reviewers."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

There are scenes inthis movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly theending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into aphilosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn'teasy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer thosequestions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and therest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but notindifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of thebest ever made. The story, the story itself is great.Honestly let me just say this 1st Sean Pean made this story come tolife, true life in every moment in the film. This movie has nothingwrong with it, it is perfect in every way shape and form. He didsomething that brought me to something I never could understand of whateither i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want amovie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this isit, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all ofthem. Its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want toleave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from myheart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what.INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so Icertainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I wasblown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talentEmile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes thefilm a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is oneof the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook isamazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (butprobably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there arepacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well andthe film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remembernoticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of AltarBoys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film.But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as CatherineKeener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone andeveryone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be forevery one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain imagesand moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker witheach movie he makes.	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

All the murder, mayhem, incredible martial arts, spurtingblood, severed limbs, funny character names, and goofy plot twists will keepyou munching your popcorn with great animation.

For adults wanting something different we have to wait for thelikes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis,or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films thatcomes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual andstorytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won'trepeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. Thecons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constantnarration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerouscalamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just akids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It'sactually a little surprising that the film got made without the peoplefinancing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to awider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot morepersonal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, andtherefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life bya director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don'tquite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood byothers. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (andthere's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in Isuspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friendswith (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles hisAsperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see suchan issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour(ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfecttouches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, andthe depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightenedMax. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommendseeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in allit's hand-made glory.It's hard to describe just how excellent this film is. The story isgreat, both very funny and touching. The art-design and animation are adelight, thoughtful, very rich in details, and very consistent instyle. The music is great. The storyline and direction... I can't finda bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- waythrough, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, amust-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you. Iagree with those comparing it to Aardman films, Waltz with Bashir andPersepolis, but this movie's animation is so professional, that onlyAardman truly compares.Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'llremember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon anunlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living inAustralia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what aprecisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliotblends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizationsto a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the pastfew years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps toenhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years inthe making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterlycaptures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantlythough, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirablycomplex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its seriousthemes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higherthan its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative,and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs.Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly notan overstatement.	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

But since it has been presented as aserious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - thatof disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience.For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that itcontains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have everseen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said -and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoilerterritory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of themajor holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your enginesand drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plotstupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there'sno record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does shekeep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needsit without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams hersister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of theshed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. Theshed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman.They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are boughtonline. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated,whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi issupposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnappedher. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would havebeen dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the housewith an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes itto her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace.Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Severaldays elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds upat Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home duringthe time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made ofthe video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for thefirst several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner.Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man whothought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13.Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the policeoff to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores ahole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - whichcauses her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme moneybelt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all hermoney. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going tolet them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to bemade of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, butisn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds -supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem asthough she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show herentering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amywinds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on herand one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash theblood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is noevidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copiousamounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amytried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possibledeath sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she electsto murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) inorder to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have beencriminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live inthe same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could goon, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had alreadywasted too much of my life on it.Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller wasderived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complexand suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances tohave come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yetdisturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, TylerPerry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as amainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audiencewithin the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario.Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunningcinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of whichmakes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.Please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense. Oh boy wheredo I start. OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tellseveryone that Neil Patrick Harris ""kidnapped"" her (Rosamund). He didthis by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which hecleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house toburn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makessuch a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to doproperly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questionsthis even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds orasks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh andthe hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. Noflipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for woundsespecially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read theother truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaringmistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense. I really wishIMDb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not evenrank a 1. I give this -5 for utter bull$h1.I have NEVER wrote a review in my life. EVER. But I feel compelled todo so for this film. I'm utterly shocked, just shocked this movie hasan 8.4 rating. What on earth are people thinking? Seriously? I could goon and on about how the plot is a complete joke. But I'll just pointout the MOST obvious of all that TOTALLY shatters any believably thatthis film ever had. Okay Amy said Desi came to her house and kidnappedher that morning. HUH? She had no clue what he was really doing thatmorning. NONE! What if he had a meeting with ten other people thatcould account for him not being at her house? What if he was havingbreakfast with someone that morning? OK next. Now how about the diary?So did Desi kidnap her then grab the diary and bring it to a house hehad no clue even existed and burn only about 20% of it? Next! When shepretends to be screaming with blood on her dress against the window sothe surveillance cameras would see her. Seriously? What about ALL theother footage those cameras captured? For example, her and Desi sittingtogether on a couch watching TV. Oh she deleted that footage? Well whatthe hell is her explanation for ALL the footage being erased except the20 seconds of her screaming. This is not me nitpicking the film andlooking super hard to try and find problems. I get it, a lot of movieshave plot holes here and there and I'm okay with that. But people!These are HUUUUGE holes in the story. Plot holes are in tons of moviesall the time. But not usually a major motion picture with a majordirector and a major movie star. And please! don't tell me shes nutsand that's why she didn't cover her tracks worth a damn. I am talkingabout the fact that she gets away with it to all the law enforcement.This belongs on Lifetime, those movies you can just shrug off. Whatbaffles me and actually really upsets me is the fact it has a rating of8.4. So please people, help me understand this. What on Earth givesthis such a high rating? What were people thinking? What?Actually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck wasexcellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evilincarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the leaddetective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I candeal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool HandLuke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, Icould only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left methat angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck andgotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would havethrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie uptill the end but that completely ruined it for me."	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It's so amazing.If you have not seen this film watch it - again and again!

Moreover, ""Koyaanisquatsi"" ""defamiliarizes""the world and humanity allowing the viewer to benefit from a""verfremdung"" viewpoint. In other words, we learn so much about our ownlife and life in general by watching it from this entirely newviewpoint of ""Koyannisqautsi"", where fast motion is used extensively.What is mankind about? Why are we moving so fast? Towards what goal?What is nature? What is the driving force of nature? What is the pulseof the earth? What is our relation with ourselves, nature and otherpeople and animals? Moreover, I think this movie is better than thesequel ""Powaquatsi"". Anyway, I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant""Koyaanisqatsi"" is. Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!This movie has no script, just visions and music.  It is very nice to watch. The photography is amazing.  This, along with the music, make it a verysurreal experience to watch.  I bought the DVD and just love it.

I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I wouldwatch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You knowthe ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in themovies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill AMockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been acontender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. ButI'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with theobvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is averitable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reignsand I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downrightafraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the bestperformance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it.Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, anddownright mortifying character to take the big screen that I canremember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis couldgo toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enoughskill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps theworld's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us whomissed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classiccinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable,identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damnedrefreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano hasbeen taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue tospout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has nobusiness rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay downyour swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was castopposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshineLewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he andLewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see thejuxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in theiracting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days offilm. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the mostbeautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the topof his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last,until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the endleaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed.Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn'tgonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, ThereWill Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt ourgeneration as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"".Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very dauntingwhilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work ofthe child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a trulyphenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity,and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At nopoint does the time period distract from the power of the film.Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve toodeep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of adocumentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film.Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from theelegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. Thecinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully capturesthe essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters.All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all ofPaul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underratedPunch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previousmovies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such asTreasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of thisfilm is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which featurevirtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heardcriticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me(and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its mostexperimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own:his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions,are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy LeeJones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggeringperformance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and againsimply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. Thisis why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when Iwas fourteen years old.PT Anderson's name already means something, or I should say somethingelse. His self assuredness alone gives me shivers. A modern artist withsuch clear and severe vision of the world. Boogie Nights, Magnolia,even Punch Drunk Love have an Wellesian disregard for what's in or out.His films are landmarks that may infuriate some, confuse others andmesmerize the rest of us. Here, with the rigorous tale of an imperviousoil man, PT Anderson outdoes himself. He has Daniel Day Lewis as hisaccomplice in a performance that would be as difficult to match as itis difficult to describe. There is a monstrous beauty here that noteven a broken nose can disguise. The saga is filled with long silentmoments of tension that take place in a cinematic canvas and an actor'shead. PT Anderson must have known that this was going to be, not onlynot a mainstream opus but a hard pill to swallow. I for one stand up toapplaud his daringness.Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does'tbelong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up tous. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the dayit's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universesand throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling,so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious.but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well bethe saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality.Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds hisunmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs OfNew York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recentlyanywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel DayLewis an unmissable work of art.If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, there issomething horribly wrong. His performance and this film were amazing. Idon't give this kind of accolade out generously. I was at the screeningat the Chelsea West. We waited outside in the cold and rain for a goodtwo hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestlysay, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of myrambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done.The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTAgives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compellingdialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of atwo-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who playsH.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A lastnight, he seemed to know everything about the story and his characterand seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He wasbreathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to seethe film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film attimes, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me. Ihad no problem with the ""slow"" scenes, but the general public may havea problem grasping this film. If anything, this will be the reason ifit gets snubbed at the Oscars."	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 andit's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-askedwar against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught inbetween (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred ofByelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to""clear"" the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven't been deported orkilled by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them isFlorya,a young boy - and in his quest to ""join the fight"" he get much more he hadbargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is takenfrom the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has beenfilmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. Theemotionalcentre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of avillage, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown withcold determination. There's no catharsis (this is not Schindler's List!),nohope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village'sdestroyers become just a sad and murderous business.""Come And See"" is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie,compared to which even classics like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (Spielbergpayeda homage to this movie on SPR's beginning) or ""The Thin Red Line"" seemsjustartificial. This is the real thing!I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about afilm before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it'sgoing to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As aresult, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, asall the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectationsout of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with ElemKlimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly hereon the IMDb. (Imagine my ""excitement"" when, having tried to see thefilm for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD aweek or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterdayand... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity andunflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See'invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what aclever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like,say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which,though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov'sfilm), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneselfto. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked,wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions thathave been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulledfrom beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, myhead hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seenbefore but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had notexperienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role ofcinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what tothink but to simply show us particular events and characters and allowus to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'mrambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is,with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a filmwhose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of avisionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an importantreminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see..."	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert isperched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be theinspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny.  This is amust-see for every one who loves old movies, and entertaining forall.I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended movie on several levels. First, it has to be seen because it won multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor, best actress and best director. So it should be seen just for it's historical significance if you are into movies as an art form. However, if you are just looking for entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The set up is that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled, independent woman who is running away from her father (in Florida) to join her husband (not quite a complete marriage) in New York City. She meets Peter (Clark Gable) on the bus who is a down & out reporter looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the bratty socialite vs the hard nosed -know it all reporter - Can they achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because the movie was made in the 30's about the 30's. This may be both good and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in a modern romantic comedy. However, his portrayal of Peter is likely typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be competent and in charge at all times (the know it all guy). The character comes across as too simplistic by today's standards. However, when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically 'white trash' was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is very evident even without having to see the performances of her rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they lack dept; however, hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry starts between Colbert and Gable (their first scene together) the rest of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an awesome experience."	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

MontyPython's Flying Circus knows how to do everything hilariously. Focusingon Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who gets mistaken for the messiah inJudea in 33 AD, the movie pokes fun at everything: Romans, Jews,imperialism, even extraterrestrials. With sardonic lines almost everyminute, they play religious fundamentalism for what it is: silly. Idon't even know which scene was my favorite; every part was so funny.You'll never forget the song at the end. This is comedy in its greatestform, and it makes sense that it would come from the guys who broughtus the ""parrot sketch"". Absolutely a hoot.True, my tastes are eclectic. This movie is so incredibly clever andthoughtprovoking that it's not surprising that it raised so many hackles. Plus,it's as fast paced and funny as a Marx Brothers movie without the musicalbreaks. You can watch it 20 times and you'll still sing at theend.Undoubtedly one of the top 10!!When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feelparticularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know thatyou've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take awell-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject isreligion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least alittle about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the westernworld, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, ofcourse, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feelthat the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes funof the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations backin 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot isabout as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should benoted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, andnot a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's aboutas paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, andthen they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes andsight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if youdon't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course,one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, butthey could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't likeall those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laughat them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomachache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of peoplewon't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't pleaseeveryone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, soevery Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python shouldgive this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and theyaren't Christian extremists. Christian ""believers"" can probably laugh at ittoo, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashedfollowers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans ofthe Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a darksense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people whoenjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligentparts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it.8/10"	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It was the hardest movie Ihave ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore humanrights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but justbecause you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this moviereceives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i cantype can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me.i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directingbecause the movie transported me. i did not think about the making ofthe movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated andinspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and whilehuman nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there isstill good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie andof the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to themovies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. thisis a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it willmake you think and feel.I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that canget me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, Imight be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personalexperiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizingthe development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography,acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watchingit. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time.The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of peoplefacing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith...Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in thesituation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinkingin international politics.It honestly shows the weakness orhelplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. Ittruthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community(or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towardsthe deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of theworld. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say whatwe see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows youhow monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail.At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful youfind those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. Themovie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassionthat the world is dreaming for.	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

The film that putStone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the mostrealistic (my father having been one of them). But in keeping the maximof giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoonbelongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked topretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Muchaccolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes isthe tour de force of his career (the scene in the village towards theend of the movie is brutal, befitting the character). With a greatscript, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is asurefire classic.I watched Platoon when I was 17 at 1987. I was on the edge ofquestioning everything and ready to uprise with a small move. Of courseI was fascinated after watching the movie and I remember I was thatclose to cry. I can definitely say Platoon is one of the best warmovies of the history. It has many incredible scenes and it reserves agreat story of brotherhood inside also vandalism and senseless of war.Charlie Sheen , William Dafoe and the great Tom Berenger can easily beconsidered as one the best combination of actors to tell a story offaith and betrayal in a movie. Oliver Stone did a great job as writerand director. I remember that I was really touched with the lettersthat Taylor ( Charlie Sheen ) writes to his grandma. Also with theamazing music of the film you feel many different things. I believethat on the last scene the picture of William Dafoe with his hands openon his knees with hundreds Viet Congs coming after him is a masterpiecework and unforgettable.I watched this movie at Osmanbey Gazi movietheater at Osmanbey-Istanbul and ı believe 70's and 80's are the besttime in Istanbul for watching a movie with big saloons and with greatatmosphere. With 90's big movie theaters started to turn to couple ofsmall saloons and with shopping malls movie theaters started to locateat malls. I really miss a lot of 80's and the taste I get from thelegend movie theaters like Osmanbey Site-Sisli Kent-Osmanbey Gazi-Pangaltı Inci-Harbiye Konak and Harbiye As.This certainly rates as one of the best Vietnam films of all time. What I especially enjoyed was the realistic atmosphere of the film, entrenching the viewer into a world which seems surreal yet believable. Oliver Stone's real-life experience in Vietnam brought a gifted outlook to this film, one drawn by experience, not common Hollywood conventions. While this proved be a lesser film to the equally amazing Full Metal Jacket, it was not by much. The performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and John C. McGinley were exceptional, capturing the plight of the tortured soldiers.Platoon left me absolutely numb after watching it. Oliver Stone,(Who infactdid serve in Vietnam) did a fantastic job telling this story of the horrorsand the insanity of the Vietnam war. What's to be admired about this film,is that Stone doesn't sweet-talk the story, with the good old American boysfighting for their country and facing brutality, instead he brings up astrong morality and humanity issue. It's wasn't all black and white, itwasn't one person was wrong, one was right, there was all shades of gray inbetween. He uses the characters of Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias (bothplayed brilliantly) as symbols of good and evil clashing into one another.Charlie Sheen (Chris, the narrator of the story) is in a sense torn betweenboth, they are both a part of him as he tries to deal with things fallingapart all around him. Vietnam was a senseless war, and Platoon tries tounderstand why we went through it and how we ever got through it.	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

When I first saw this film, it left me in tears andspeechless for quite some time after. When I watch it today, it still does!I don't believe anyone can watch this film and not become moved or evenshaken by what he/she sees and hears! If the movie has one shortcoming,it'sthat the main character, prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him), is neveractually seen or heard, as it would have been a deadly sin to have an'imposter' playing Him in the movie. Although this takes some getting usedto and creates some lengths (i.e. dialogs which are rather more monologueswith pauses), the rest of the movie compensates in full! Watching thismoviewill probably not make you go out to become a muslim (although I have readthat most of the cast/crew involved did so), but certainly put some thoughtand understanding into you. One of the must see movies or alltime!!!Anthony Quinn is no doubt one of the greatest actors of the 20thcentury...The strange thing is that he fits to the muslim roles with such aperfection that, with his contribution ""The Message"" and ""The Lion of theDessert"" both have been masterpieces which are still watched by many people.Though the theme of this movie is the birth of Islam, I think it should havea variety of audience from many religions and cultures. I think the thingsthat are emphasized, the struggle for the cause you believe, the sacrificesyou have made for the beloved, are all universal values that have beenemphasized with a rather outstanding casting and directing...I thinkeveryone should watch this movie no matter what his/her religion, thought,culture is...Thanks Moustapha Akkad, Thanks Anthony Quinn, Thanks Irene Papas....You havemade an excellent movie.....This is a truly excellent movie.

Itinvolved me more than at least 99% of other films I've seen, and the maincharacter, Cabiria, is a character to cherish and love forever (of course,we who have seen La Strada are already partly familiar with the character).I've hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only fiveminutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. GiuliettaMasina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, herhusband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they couldmatch their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded insurpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain andsimple. 	A prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the humanspirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,' directed by Federico Fellini. Giulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages tomaintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences thatwould leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward offand emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves heropen to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is justthat optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her soendearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her ownhouse, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she isvulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victimto those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established inthe opening scene of the film. 	Fellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet stilltriumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It'ssomething of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knockeddown before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time,however, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmostcruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow givesabsolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly doher harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message ofhope and redemption.  	As Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing lessthan superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and amanner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini capturesevery bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that sheis a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost etherealpresence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that givesher character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype onemay assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.'  It is a heartfelt,memorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar forBest Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is FrancoisPerier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life withan offer that ultimately seems too good to be true.	The supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani(The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante(Cripple in the `Miracle' sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo(Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  `Nights of Cabiria' is a filmof extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellinihas created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning andindelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina,this is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you longafter the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria,Fellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense ofinnate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.  For seekersafter wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. I rate this one 10/10.   As a film-lover, there are movies that I've outgrown, movies thatdisappointingly lose their connection to me as I age and mature. Fellini's""Le Notti di Cabiria"" is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. Itgrows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved indifferent ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, GiuliettaMasina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that commentson its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament thatthis gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will helpremedy the movie-going public's oversight. The film's rich concluding scenealone (and Masina's glance into our eyes) remains one of the most magicalmoments ever projected on a screen."	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

If there was ever a film that foreshadowed to events of thefuture it would be ""Network"". Much like ""Midnight Cowboy"" seven yearsearlier, ""Network"" was hailed because it took risks and it was like nothingthat the cinema had ever experienced before. Both films were great when theywere initially released, but few great films become so much better with timelike ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Network"". The fictional fourth network of 1976is UBS. Ratings are bad and the network desperately needs some new show togive them a boost to challenge NBC, CBS, and ABC. Enter the network'snational news anchorman (Peter Finch in his posthumous Oscar-winning role).He, like the network, is going through a crossroads. His wife has justpassed away, he is about to be fired, and he is slowly losing his mind. Thefiring is imminent and he decides that he will announce to the world that hewill commit suicide on his last evening news broadcast. Of course a nationalfrenzy starts, but Finch surprises all by showing just how crazy he is.Instead of committing suicide, he goes on the air and becomes a modern-dayMoses to some with crazed ravings and outlandish statements that really arejust the ramblings of a man slowly spinning out-of-control. Faye Dunaway(Oscar-winning) and Robert Duvall are the key people at the network who finda way to market Finch and boost anemic ratings. Finch is given a varietyshow which could be best described as ""The Tonight Show"" gone stark-ravingmad. He gets on stage and basically says whatever is on his mind and thecrowds love it. Co-worker and close personal friend William Holden(Oscar-nominated) knows that Finch is out of control, but cannot do anythingand eventually is let go due to his disapproval and interference. Holdenthough has fallen in love, or lust, with the unfeeling Dunaway. WifeBeatrice Straight (in an Oscar-winning performance in which she has lessthan 10 minutes of screen-time) learns of what is going on and more troubleensues for Holden on the home-front. Finch meanwhile continues his ravingsas he hears voices in his head telling him what he must do each time he isasked to perform. Soon his act grows stale as the public tires of his anticsand the network must always defend speeches that they themselves do notreally understand. Finch's ""15 minutes"" of fame eventually come to an end,but not in the conventional way that one may think. ""Network"" is a cinematicmasterpiece because it is so strong in the major elements of the industry.The acting is exceptional. There were five performing nominations from thisfilm (Ned Beatty was the fifth) and three wins. The only other film toaccomplish that was ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" from 1951. Sidney Lumet wasgreat before this film, but he became even greater afterwards. This isarguably his greatest directing job. The screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky isone of the smartest ever written. It is insightful and has a real depth toit. ""Network"" was looked upon as a sort of ""far-fetched black comedy"" in1976. However, ""Network"" is a film that is all too realistic 25 years later.In many ways the fictional UBS station is much like the FOX station whichcame on the air in the late-1980s and stole audiences with wild shows thatwere quite different from the other three networks. Reality television,perverted talk shows, and other types of variety programming run wild today.""Network"" did not have much to do with all this occurring, but it is likethose who worked on the film had a crystal ball into the future. A greatmovie that becomes greater as time passes. 5 stars out of 5.   To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 couldonly means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky wasseeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the laterof the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn'tborn yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature,etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves givesChayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chumsFinch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in anyAmerican movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb,superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives aperformance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man,the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From GoldenBoy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his owndiscomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarmingcharacter in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent inher thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercialamorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precisionof an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, BeatriceStraight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes thisone of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable filmfrom the 70's. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he's as good as hismaterial. Here he is at his zenith."	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewingthis film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller wasgoing to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing whenwatching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your averagefilm-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thoughtrequired. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically anddefinitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone whowas never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so muchrange to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film isexcellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. Ialways enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film andwhere the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one ofthe most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to theactual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write thiswhile I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island iscertainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a differenttake for the director, and he does it, as he does every film,perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don'twant to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island wascompletely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all thecomponents of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on fromevery character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script isfantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in awhile (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to theset's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyonewill like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. Tothose, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for acompelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that youmight think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it wasso entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you seethis at the next Oscars...I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I hadalready read about half of the book but never got the chance to finishit. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the originalmaterial.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I sawsome cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directedBringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyonewas top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though Iwould jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. Allin all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performancesand for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far.	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It seems from another world, which in a way, it is.The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements andintense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, whileCharles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to thescreen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest ofthe cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimbaare incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly butbelievably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst ofthe hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing isflawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension withjust a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt aswell as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison isSpielberg's early gem, ""The Duel"", but Clouzot's automotive cinematicsoutdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of thecharacters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimyscenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latteris what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of themost dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen.Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated withthe rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes ona surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic.One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore.The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its owntriumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to theaudience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrityand potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were oncelarger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came toacting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginativelives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity withinan artificial corporate star-making incubator.This movie is a true masterpiece in every way! When I rented the DVDand read the story it sounded familiar, because I had watched the newerversion before in color with Roy Scheider, which was good as well. Butwatching the original film truly blew me away. This movie is well madein every detail. It puts a lot of detail-work in the creation of thecharacters, and once you think that is over and the ""regularaction-part"" starts, it becomes even better and the story takes a 90degree turn! After I had finished watching the entire movie, I neededat least 5 minutes just to ""digest"" it and rethink this fantastic film.If you got a chance to watch it, don't miss it! It is entertaining fromthe first to the last minute!A completely novel plot.  Happened upon this on late night TV about 10 years ago.  Thought I had seen all the best of the classics and then this came on.  ""Where have you been all my life?"" was the overwhelming question.  What an incredibly beautiful and stark movie at the same time.  Absolutely unprecedented.  Everything about it--especially thecinematography (check out the scene with the turnabout for the trucks) is superior.  If you care about plot, allegory, intelligent directing and acting, this is one which is second to none.  Nitroglycerine being transported across the Venezuelan countryside. . .who comes up with this stuff?  The remake (Sorcerer) is decent, but doesn't even come close.  Outstanding flick.  Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, byHenri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by WilliamFriedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, theearlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so.Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate andthe various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to theSouth American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-riskingjobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES...distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience morerooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, withcharismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider(SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form ofbeguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand. Bothfilms have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all thestaging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangelyslow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in theirless-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough goodthings in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time andresources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!""The Wages of Fear"" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of whichwere made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Buñuel. Cluozot'sown screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on fourdown-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter VanEyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town inan unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highlydangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote wellfire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is throughjungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men aredesperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic orgenerous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by themanagers of oil company because ""if something happens to them, no onewould care, they have nobody to worry about them"". Henri-GeorgesClouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he findsa way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperatecharacters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a grippingaction film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay forlong time in our memory.Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two ofthe greatest thrillers of all time, 'Les Diaboliques' and 'The Wages OfFear', both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful moviesthat build up an amazing amount of tension.  Most so-called thrillers madein Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lessonor two from these movie classics. 'The Wages Of Fear' could even bedescribed as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, andthat's what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spansmight find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie,which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin Americantown, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impacton the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters andexploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depthand meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarelyachieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them,are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yvesMontand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old palthe kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter vanEyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginativedirection, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the mostriveting sequences ever committed to film make 'Wages Of Fear' a trulyunforgettable experience.

It's that part of you thatholds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope forhumanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it isabout investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in thecatholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that.Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true faceof the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. Fcked upthings happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens tothe innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When theyare robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting inthe film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front ofme a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I wasboth shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably.""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you,it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When wewitness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it,that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millionstalking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into thenight."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicatethe oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedicationof the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and thecinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviewsand knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint!Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my lifegrowing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went tochurch every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priestlure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of thisamazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic churchand the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims.The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors thatI am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie thatmakes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear thatthis abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. Theexclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and toldthe rest of us ""...I am a survivor...""

Humphrey Bogart chews the scenery in his star-making turnasacid-tongued private eye Sam Spade, whose association with the beautifulandaloof Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), neurotic Joel Cairo (PeterLorre),and morbidly obese Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in hisOscar-nominatedscreen debut) over the recovery of the title object, sets in motion amovieexperience that is as much crackling as it is dazzling.  While much oftheaction and dialogue is considerably dated by modern standards, the film'sessential power to mystify and entrance remains undiminished despite itsage.  While this was the third adaptation of Hammett's story (the firstwasmade in 1931 and the second was ""Satan Met a Lady"" (1936)), this is alsothebest remembered and most praised, due largely in part to Bogart'sseeminglyeffortless portrayal of the tough but softhearted, world-weary hero.MaryAstor and Lee Patrick were, respectively, the definitive femme fatale andgirl Friday, and the villianous roles of Cairo, Gutman and Wilmer (ElishaCook Jr.) were equally remarkable.  What may not be wholly obvious is thefact that these three men have homosexual tendencies (as given in thenovel), but just look at what's given: Cairo's delicate speech andmanner,Wilmer's questionable quick tempered attitude towards Spade (could thisbecovering up the fact that he finds Spade attractive?) and Gutman'sclutchingof Spade's arm when Sam arrives at his hotel room.  A polished film noirthat gave rise to Bogart's mounting popularity.  (Sidenote: The characterofSam Spade was originally offered to George Raft, who turned it down.Raftalso turned down ""Casablanca"" (1942), ""High Sierra"" (1941) and WilliamWyler's ""Dead End"" (1937), all of which went to Bogart and helped toboosthis star status.  Bogart had Raft to thank for his enduring popularity.)Amust-see masterpiece.

These two work so welltogether that the film would have been impressive no matter what.However, with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill,""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was the smash-hit of 1969 as itachieved box office dominance and won more Oscars (four) than any otherfilm that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscarsas ""Midnight Cowboy"" and its director John Schlesinger took home thosehonors, but it has stood the test of time and is right up there withthe other imperative films of that important year (""Midnight Cowboy"",""Easy Rider"", and ""The Wild Bunch""). The two titled characters are twoshrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However, the law hasabout had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is theplace they need to be. Also along for the ride is school-teacherKatharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both wantto go straight in Bolivia, but temptation is too big for them and inthe end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course thisfilm is based on real people, but so little is known about them thatthe film-makers were able to take many liberties with the tale. Thefilm-makers went for comedy and action, but it is the drama and thelikable characters that make ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" oneof the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What touched me themost was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actorsperformances were incredible. They are why you should see this film.'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film;it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coatedmanner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago andwas blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see suchfresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this filmoffered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiringfilm that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywoodoften gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone.You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting.Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no oneunderstands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you haveat a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life.Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. Thefilm is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys whodecide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks theirinterest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy'smind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others,butmostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about fouryoung boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical.I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the timebefore. This is a perfect little film. Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in secondplace). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it thefirst time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie isdefinitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of amovie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can.But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friendswho have no experience with the ""real world"". They find out about adead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to befamous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the moviereveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, theboys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realizethat the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinionthe point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what youdo with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and howeach kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of themovie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip myhat to Reiner."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It is so well told, sorealistic,that the viewer gets involved in the Northern Ireland conflict.The acting is superior, the directing is great - a truly astonishingmovie.10/10Jim Sheridan's astonishingly fantastic 'In the Name of the Father'tells the brutally direct story of a wrongfully accused family who aretortured into making a false confession and imprisoned by the Britishjustice system. Sheridan has a way of telling his stories where he getsstraight to the point and does not fear to show the reality of thesituation while keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats. The filmis based on Gerry Conlan's autobiography where Daniel Day-Lewis playsthe central character. Sheridan effectively portrays Gerry andGiuseppe's struggle and fight against injustice and his portrayal ofthe corrupt British justice system is frightening. Just the idea thatpeople could get away with such things in a country like the UK ischilling and Sheridan skillfully brings that across on screen. TerryGeorge's brilliant screenplay with rich characters and solid dialoguesforms a good backbone for the film. I also liked how the humour wasinfused in a modest dose as not to interfere with the intensity of thestory. There are some excellent performances. Daniel Day-Lewis deliversa suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into the rolewhile Pete Postlethwaite is sublime and equally outstanding as Gerry'sfather, Giuseppe. Though father and son do have issues to fight over,it is Giuseppe who is Gerry's conscience and Postlethwaite'sheartbreaking act really touches the heart. Emma Thompson holds her ownand she is simply excellent. The rest of the cast do a superb job(watch out for Tom Wilkinson in a bit role). The soundtrack fits themood of the film and the cinematography is good, especially in theprison sequences, where it creates that feeling of claustrophobia whichgets stronger after Gerry is alone in his cell. I have liked all ofSheridan's ' films that I have seen so far and 'In The Name Of TheFather' is another remarkable film from this fine director. It is adifficult movie to watch due to some disturbing themes and scenes(though most of them are rather suggestive it is the idea behind thatsends chills down the spine) but it is definitely worth watching.	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The trailer was promising and since many people praisedthis movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time""to indulge in the deep content and story it provides"". There wasabsolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictatorwho holds all the water and controls the people. Let's escape, make adiversion, trap him, beat the living hell out of him and return to behappily accepted as the new rulers. Hurray.if you wanna go and see this movie, please expect nothing butfrustrating, dazing, predictable outcome action, and then just when youthink the movie is ending you get an extra 30-45 minutes of the sameaction same explosions, same cars and faces doing the same thing theydid during the whole first half of the movie. Do not expect anyengaging drama or any plot of any kind, but here's the story: postapocalypse, no water (yet there are hundreds of people alive andworking), no fuel (yet they all have it in their vehicles), womenescaping  women returning back the same day. What a plot! Visually itwas stunning, but that's all you get.An action essential through and through, it's plain and simple! Sincethe days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turnedinto a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard tocreate entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to badcomposition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have hadsome fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The DarkKnight', but certain directors cough Michael Bay... don't seem to beable to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potentialand instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shakycamera-work among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: FuryRoad', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since therelease of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decidedto return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, hetruly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of anaction film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going tobe hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Millerdidn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previousfilms. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the newbackdrop for post- apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is anexhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creatingwhat might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearingthat nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blewme away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequentfireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action toreignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome ofthe action genre."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It depicts someevents in the life of Antoine Doinel, a young French boy who gets intoa lot of trouble no matter what he does. This was the first film byFrancois Truffaut, and I believe that it is filmed with such aninnocence that you can really feel some of the emotions that Antoinefeels. I love the simple style of this film, and I think it adds to itscharm. The story is can even be painful to watch as one sees all of thethings that happen to Antoine. I think that the reason for the strongemotions embedded in this film is that it is semi-autobiographical. Ithink the cinema is what rescued Truffaut from a life like hisprotagonist.In short, an inspiration to all filmmakers-they DEFINITELYdon't make them like this anymore!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales) is about sixdifferent and independent stories with one thing in common: the limitof our patience, or like it's tagline says...""All may lose control"".Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn'tlook for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It's almost impossiblenot to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of theirsituations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in somepassages make us feel uncomfortable. And the merit of director DamiánSzifrón is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination ofintrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor.

It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it'scentral theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easilyreach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts aboutwider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It isviolent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story ofSolomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about theway Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it soastonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, notbecause the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heartstrings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer.This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough tounderstand it.Let me start off by saying that I like a good movie based on a truestory like Schindler's List, The Butler, A Beautiful Mind, We Bought AZoo, etc., etc. I'm also fully aware that not all events will beentirely factual so when I went into this movie I wasn't going inexpecting accuracy in any form. What I did go in expecting was a goodperformance by great actors and I must say the acting was fantastic,but unfortunately the rest of the film was a complete train wreck. Ifelt it had potential at first and then that feeling quickly dissipatedafter watching the first beating commence and continued to diminishafter seeing the attempted hanging where he walked around on his toesfor at least a good twenty to thirty seconds and we had to sit andwatch. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get more boringbut then they threw in yet another thirty second scene where we allproceeded to stare at the main character's face while he sat idle,occasionally moving his head from side to side. I wanted to feelemotion for these poor characters but every emotion that I had wasquickly ruined by incredibly long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes.Not only did I have to sit through the agonizing, stretched out scenesbut whenever there was about to be a significant lapse of time withinthe main character's life they'd add in a bonus five to seven secondswhere we stared at a bunch of trees. I'd like to say that I was movedby the movie or felt some sort of enjoyment in watching it but in truththe only touching moment I truly had was at the end of the film when Irealized it was FINALLY over. I'd liken it's boringness to The FifthEstate but honestly it was far worse. My advice to you would be toignore the plethora of ten star reviews and think twice before youdecide to pick it up for movie rental once it finally comes out on DVD.	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

This is followed by a series of images that includes a spider, a montage from silent comedies, a spike being driven through a man's hand, and faces in a morgue. The film then cuts to an enigmatic picture of a young boy watching women's faces appear on a giant screen directly in front of him. Are these strange images reminding us that we are only observing a film, not reality? As Persona begins, Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), a nurse, is assigned to care for an actress, Elizabeth Vogler (Liv Ullman) who suddenly ceases to speak in the middle of a performance of Electra. Alma learns that there is nothing physically or psychologically wrong with Elizabeth. She just refuses to communicate verbally. Alma and Elizabeth retreat to the head physician's summer cottage on a small island to complete her recuperation. Although Alma is the only one who talks, the relationship grows and Alma is happy that she has found someone who will listen to her sympathetically. She begins to share with Elizabeth some of her most vulnerable moments. A high point in the film is Alma's detailed description of a sexual encounter she had with two teenage boys while sunbathing on a beach in the nude. Elizabeth appears to be an attentive listener who, by facial expression, encourages Alma to reveal more and more personal details. Alma, however, is deeply hurt when she opens Elizabeth's unsealed letter to her doctor. In the letter, Elizabeth reveals how she is using Alma as a ""study"" and finds her infatuation ""charming"". Feeling betrayed Alma lashes out in anger, first berating her patient, then begging for forgiveness. As soon as physical and emotional violence is depicted, Bergman stops the narrative and repeats images from the opening sequence, adding a close-up of an eye as if to remind us again that we are merely prying observers. The relationship of the two women now becomes a struggle of wills. Alma grows more desperate as Elizabeth gets stronger and more dominant. Sensing this new power, Elizabeth seems to transfer her personality to the weaker Alma. Every nuance of emotion is unforgettably conveyed in the facial expressions of these two remarkable actresses. Persona is filled with surreal images and dream sequences in which it is very difficult to distinguish between illusion and reality. In one scene, Alma sees Elizabeth entering her room at night, then exiting. When Alma asks her the next morning if she was in her room, Elizabeth shakes her head no. We do not know if she is simply not telling the truth, or the event did not occur. Bergman does not offer help. The same is true for scenes when Mr. Vogler appears or when Elizabeth looks at a picture of her son that she tore up at the beginning of the film. Being left on our own to make sense of these discontinuous elements, we are forced to discard thinking in traditional linear ways. I can't say that I fully understood Persona. It may be suggesting that the persona we assume is merely a mask to cover our fears and insecurities? It seems that Elizabeth is playing a role as actress, wife, and mother. She wants to abandon this inauthentic role by refusing to speak. Alma, on the other hand, acts like a dutiful wife and supportive nurse, but secretly yearns to be what she perceives Elizabeth to be: strong, independent, and self-reliant. In a memorable scene, the faces of the two women are morphed into one composite in a classic overlapping shot, an image that says to me that underneath the roles we play, we are all the same.After successive viewings, however, I realized that Persona's greatness does not lie in understanding, but in its unbearably intimate and poetically realized images, magnificently conveyed by cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The raw power of this film totally drew me in and allowed me to get in touch with my own feelings of hurt and desperation in trying to reach people in my own life who cannot or will not respond. Persona is not just a classic I objectively admired, but a very powerful personal experience."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films  which, of course, is not at all a bad thing). The experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen  and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed.Despite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely. It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).My verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many ""sandal and sword"" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history. Pure cinema and a must see  10 stars out of 10.I own over 2,000 movies on DVD or VHS. I have gone to many many moremovies that have not been worthy of my collection, thus my exposure tofilm has been extensive. I mention this because through every film Ihave seen; I still come back to a film from 1959 as the greatestachievement in cinematic history. I have seen great films like: Returnof the King, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart and many more. While themodern films are wonderful and have a fantastic richness to them, theystill are a ""small"" notch below Ben-Hur. Today's films use a lot ofcomputer effects for their battles scenes, their backgrounds, and evencomputer images for the stunts of their actors. Yet, Ben-Hur did it allwithout computers. I am still fascinated by the chariot race. Never, infilm history, has anything matched the depth and excitement of thechariot race. Remember folks, this is 1959, nothing is computergenerated. Some may say the naval battle scenes look a bit cheesy, butagain it was 1959 and the scenes still work today. What can you sayabout the acting? Every single actor is wonderful. Heston is in topform as Ben-Hur. Steven Boyd is incredible playing the mercilessMessala. Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott--all fantastic intheir roles. Each performing the role of a life time. The actors arefantastic, but William Wyler brings more out of each actor than anydirector ever could in this day and age. Wyler had no computeranimation to rely on, he had no high tech special effects crew, he hadno computer program to fill in extras. Wyler had to find thousands ofextras for many scenes and maintain control. Did you ever see StevenBoyd better? Probably not. Did you ever see any of the actors (exceptHeston, who is an acting marvel) better in any other role? Wyler justpulled the greatest performance out of each actor. The story: fantasticfrom beginning to end. While the film is over 3 hours long, you do notfeel that it is that long. Every scene is lovingly crafted: the reunionbetween Messala and Judah, the trek to the gallows, the rowing scene,the naval battle, the chariot race, the Messala death scene, thereunion with Judah and his family, etc. After seeing thousands andthousands of movies, I always come back to Ben-Hur. This is the mark offantastic movie making. Today's film makers could learn a lot bywatching this film and ""learning"" about acting, directing, and screenwriting.There's a reason Ben-Hur captured more academy awards than any other film(until Titanic).  A close to perfect production which exceeds expectationsfor a film of religious nature.  The only way to watch Ben-Hur is via thewidescreen DVD - presented in 2:7.1 scope - most probably the widest moviefilmed.   The only reason I didn't give it a '10' is because of CharltonHeston.  A much overrated actor who overacts at every opportunity andbecomes quite tiresome.  Fortunately, there was so much more in Ben-Hur,that his overacting goes unnoticed.   The chariot race is still THE mostexciting sequence I've ever seen in a film.  Get over the religious issueand give Ben-Hur its due.There's a reason Ben-Hur captured more academy awards than any other film(until Titanic).

Hislatest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin FilmFestival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale withinanother tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged asthough a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has lethis imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as theauthor of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as theyoung author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe GrandBudapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within thetale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is setin the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious trainride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: RalphFiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe,Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countlesscameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined forArt house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. Theproduction design and music are outstanding and even the end creditsare imaginatively done (and received another ovation from theaudience).21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand BudapestHotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen onlyone trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plotwhatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found mewatching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. Thiswas the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of TheGrand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop amountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy.This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting.There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quiterefreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments whereseveral members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followedby slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with.As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, JeffGoldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson andHarvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performancesmust go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who playsZero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worthwatching.Having been to a few of Wes Anderson's films, the twee, absurdcaricature, dead-pan precious, lush, scenic, cardboard Tim Burton-esquecinematography that many insisted is synonymous with ""intelligenthumour"" were all expected. What wasn't is the insufferable, sophomoricidiocy of the story, gratuitous characters and shallowness of the plot,the script, the character development, the entire purpose of the makingof this film. What on earth is it suppose to say?! What deeper layersare there to uncover other than it being a madcap caper aboutpromiscuous hotel staff carrying on with obscenely rich geriatrics,murderous villains and relatives, an outrageous and unbelievablejailbreak adventure? What is the point to this wedding cake indulgenceof a film, exactly? And please don't sniff haughtily with a ""You justdon't get its brilliance/genius/subversion/provocation,blah..blah...blah...go watch a Tom Cruise flick!"" retort. I honestlydon't get much more from this film than its gruel thin plot."	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

They'reabsolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMESsaid in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood thananything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself.For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark,edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABYrepresents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid andintelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, thenoble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above andapart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The BoxingRing As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywooditself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP,GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY,ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood thedirector brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both thesetting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerablesub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood theactor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beatenpresence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness,Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to anddisappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars HilarySwank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikelyprotegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give whatare without question the best performances of their respective careers:deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelmingimpacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotousfight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutualdependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggiein both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in aworld pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-flooredsquare ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confronttheir various demons, battling for both victory and personalredemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improvingon its source material without betraying the concise but compellingsituations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's shortstories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusivescore is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls andlost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured majorstudio movie of the decade.Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, oneof the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more thanenough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster,mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or,hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy hismillions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget,heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime""""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a betterplace for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films thathave something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, MillionDollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly expressthemes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one'sself. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable andpersonally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while alsofrowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie andjudge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones whereI leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or adesire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latestmore than succeeds on those counts.I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about tosee a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze.Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to ClintEastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormousproportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming,clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a verydifferent lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological,lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie tothem, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room tomaneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable tostretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, KevinBacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostlymen but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold.Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with aperformance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is atriumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's acompliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar forher performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad thatshe was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Likeshe didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge.She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of anactor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years oldand hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. MorganFreeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition hedeserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listingof viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is toodeep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for somelame-brain movie like Fat Albert.Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film,one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it everytime. I loved first and foremost its message that we create ourselvesthrough our drive, loyalty, ambition, dedication, and work. Secondly, Ilove its insistence in the good of the American Dream, and I loved itsexcitement and beautiful, touching message toward the end. A movieabout violence and ambition that evolves into a movie about love,hard-earned sacrifice, and doing something meaningful with one's life.Grade A entertainment with a beautiful message to boot! Hilary Swankand Clint Eastwood should both win their second Oscars for theircontribution to cinema."	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I`m not talking about politics. maybeyou haven`t lived violence as near as i have, but im gonna tell yousomething, that is the main reason i voted 9 this movie: Amores perros isnot fiction. Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensivemodels that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes,we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we havehouses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as youthink.Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`sit.What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you.Yourè seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle,paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amoresperros,and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surpriseyou'Amores Perros' impressed the hell out of me. Three interrelated tales ofthe darker side of life in contemporary Mexico City, each one as fresh andas fascinating as the last. Each of the three stories are dark, disturbingand filled with humanity. Superbly acted all round, but especiallynoteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, apolitical dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal(Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in themaking I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity ofmost current Hollywood ""product"", and to my mind ranks with a small handfulof movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun')that are truly memorable and with genuine substance. This one is a winnerand essential viewing for all movie lovers. A future classic.Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of theovertly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic,because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involvingthe people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of thesubtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I haveever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than thecomparably immature ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""). Here we get an intertwiningtale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model,a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. Asyou might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, andthe dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict uponeach other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyondrepair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine.Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart thanyou might initially perceive, ""Amores Perros"" is a deep,thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soonforget."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever.Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movieever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible foreight-year-oldsacross the country, but it has never been regarded as artisticallysuperior.When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive moviesever.It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantasticartdirection and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality(which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flawsofa theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc.and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen withgreat acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges fromforeshadowingthe appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composedscenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside fromtechnical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of humanintrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-reveringnature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one ofthefirst movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingeniousaspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals ratherthanruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans areportrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaursis wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyzethe movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at thetime, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, apaleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's newtheme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There isplenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  SamNeill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can reallybelieve he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems toplay himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who isconvinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects areamazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better thanthis!Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destinedto become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, greatspecial effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams,incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of thegreatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true tothe book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good becauseit is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter)Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and astandard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains somescenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see thedinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with theraptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in thejeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I willkeep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day idie.JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and droveme to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I waseleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I neverfinished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, Idecided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast,my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. Westood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even asthe lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within momentsI was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favoritescenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For thenext two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as thesemarvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seenbefore. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theatervirtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been,and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was aturning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself,""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogueisn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actorsare good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and thedinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing(after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, butnone of them matter. This film is great entertainment.Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that Isaw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had agood plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave andsee it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocksand suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy theJurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great,and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is atrue genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Since his fame increased, his older works has been taken from thedrawers to upper shelves and this is leading to discussions of which ofhis works are better than which. Kaze no tani no Naushika has beencompared many times with his Mononoke - hime, however regarding howNaushika formed a perfect background for the further works of Miyazaki,this comparison is not very fair. Kaze no tani no Naushika is the basisof Miyazaki's charming mastery which becomes more and more apparent in1990s. It features one of the greatest heroines in anime history in anunusual sci-fi environment. The story of the film shows us howresourceful human imagination can be. What makes Naushika a cornerstoneis not only this efficient story telling but also the visual fiestathat it has been presented in. So lose no time in comparing this filmto another, instead savor it again and again.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

In TOUCH OF EVIL the""noirish"" dark streets and shadows are darker than ever, practicallyswallowing up the soft tones like a murky swamp. The action takes placein a nondescript U.S./Mexico border town where the worst that bothsides has to offer is most in evidence. The famous opening scene (a 31/2-minute continuous shot) where we witness a time bomb being placedin the trunk of a Cadillac is masterful. The camera pulls in and out ofthe city scene as it follows the motion of the vehicle winding its waythrough streets littered with pedestrians, thus effectively creating alevel of anxiety that could not be duplicated with multiple edits.After the inevitable explosion, the drama dives into a seedy world ofcorrupt police justice and malevolent decrepitude, which is filmed withsuch a stylish flair, it is almost weirdly humorous and playful! MikeVargas, the good guy, is played by Charlton Heston and seems more thana wee bit miscast as a Mexican narcotics officer with his face darkenedby makeup. When U.S. Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) firstmeets him he remarks, ""He doesn't look Mexican."" Quinlan is theultimate repugnant cop gone bad and Welles has the camera looking upinto his nostrils most of the time making his character look even moremonstrous. But Quinlan is also pitifully sad. A man who once had theinstincts of a cat and the intelligence of a fox has been reduced to aninsignificant mass of tissue, who's ""instinct"" is having a knack forfinding evidence that he himself has planted. And while he may berevered by the local officials in law enforcement, he's acutely awarethat he is a fraud and petrified that Vargas, has seen him naked.Touch of Evil has, perhaps, the BEST cinematography and lighting in ANY filmever made.  Not just in the film noir genre, but in all categories.  OrsonWelles tended to use wide shots for all of his films, and Touch of Evil'suse of wide shots took filmmaking to another level, especially with theamazing opening shot.  The camera techniques and lighting are toospectacular to fathom, it is the grandmaster of all movies.  Brilliant is anunderstatement.  See this film, if not for the excellent acting and sheerbrilliance in terms of the camera (this film had a GREAT D.P.!!), but forentertainment value.  But if you are a film student or just want to seegreat camera work, Touch of Evil will astonish you.Orson Welles made this film over 15 years after ""Citizen Kane"", but eventhough it doesn't reach the level of ""Kane"", he never lost his genius touch.With a basic story and regular budget he made the most famous B-film ever.His majesty in the camera control and the editing jump out of the screen.His director geniality is seen through the outstanding performances by greatactors like himself, Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietricht, and actors not thatgreat, like Charlton Heston. Several lines of this motion picture areamongst the greatest of all times, specially the Dietrich ones. Thecredits scene, that runs uncut for about 3 minutes, is one of the greatestmoments in the film history, along with the pianola tune at Tanya's place.Some might say that ""Touch of Evil"" is banal and boring, but these are thepeople that don't like real motion pictures, and we all know that, so wedon't care about them."	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I'd sayit'smore of a science fiction film than most of what Hollywood passes off aspart of the genre, most of which are simply action films with a sci-fibent.Stalker is science fiction in the vein of the genres greatest writerslikePhillip K. Dick and Stanislaw Lem.  It's pure science fiction, based onscience, metaphysics and speculation, not some action fantasy or spaceoperathat fits into the genre on the technicality that it takes place ""in thefuture"" or ""a long, long time ago"".   The film is slow...very slow but ithas to be to put you into the mindset of the film.  After the opening 30minutes the pacing actually draws you into the film in a more personal waymore than any Cyborg-post-apocalyptic-hell crap Hollywood could spew out.This film is truly sci-fi, and truly great sci-fi.For me, it's, quite simply, the best film ever made; Don't you find youcan pause any Tarkovsky film at any moment and the art on your screenis good enough to have as a poster on your wall for life ? With Stalkerit is doubly true. The first time I experienced the tunnel scene myheart nearly stopped. This was in 1984 I watched the TV listings inEngland for 20 years waiting for a repeat - finally buying the DVD in2004, though I couldn't really afford it. Proof that a SCI-FI film doesnot need tons of effects to work. In a science fiction film book I readyears ago they rated Stalker as the only film ever made deserving fullmarks in all 3 sections. Imagine if Tarkovsky had made a film of one ofPKD's novels ?! OK, I'm dreaming ?! We are lucky to have been blessedby his genius. The good die young. All the best, Rich (English, 38 yrs,Paris)There have been some comments about this film's length. I am initiallyreminded of the scene in ""Amedeus"" where Mozart is told that hiscomposition has ""Too many notes"" to this he replies ""There are justenough..."" This film offers great insight into the inner workings ofnot just the creative mind but the social will of mankind. If you are aviewer who enjoys film please disregard the whining of those who don'tenjoy investigating thoroughly the possibility of a well thought outand concise perspective and please watch this masterpiece of modernfilm. The director leads the viewer through some profound aspects ofhumanity with such brilliance and in my opinion swiftness that to passit by would be a shame.Stalker (1979)½ Stalker is rich, spiritual and contemplative journeythrough the fantastic inner world of human's hope, desire, disillusionsand believes. Main characters, Writer (as incarnation of irrational,imaginative and emotional aspects of our nature or subconsciousness)and Scientist (rational, logic forces or consciousness) are guided byStalker (symbolizing our desire, will and everlasting search ofmeaning) to the mysterious Zone (which may represent all our spiritualgoals, meanings, struggles to achieve them and barriers in our path).Breathtaking and mesmerizing images and sounds, witty dialog and strongconcept are the major virtues of this feature. Writer's monologues areamong the most meaningful, thought-provoking and spiritual moments Iever experienced in any art. But the movie is overlong losing itspowerful initial momentum and becoming inconsistent in it's finalmessage (by final I don't mean last in chronology but overall).Tarkovsky's earlier SF drama ""Solaris"" is more structured and fullydeveloped. Nevertheless, Stalker is an outstanding piece of art moviethat puts its director among the few true cinema masters.

Released in 1940 and till now this movie is asfresh as it can be. John Ford directorial version of John Steinbeck'sfinest work really worth a watch.As from the release of the book""Grapes of Wrath"" has been seiged with controversies as the book wasbanned in many states but the book is great proponent of hardship. Thismovie mesmerizes you from the start as the characters are indulged withtrue humanitarian instincts, you won't feel any thing irrelevant.HenryFonda is very much compelling in the role of young Todd and JaneDarwell won best supporting actress in magnificent portrayal of MamaTodd. All the other cast was fine and convincing in their roles .JohnFord won another best director award from this and its no doubt thebest deserving from his other achievements .In the end it's a treat andyou wont be able to forget its impact for a long time.""The Grapes of Wrath"" was a huge novel so it only made sense to turn itintoa feature motion picture. The result is one of the greatest films everproduced. Oscar-nominee Henry Fonda, his mother Jane Darwell(Oscar-winning)and their family have had it in the Dust Bowl. Thus they decide to leavethemidwest of our nation's Great Depression and go to California. The film isan intensely dramatic affair that is first-rate in all cinematicdepartments. John Ford won his second Best Director Oscar with this movieand the landscape of the late-1920s and early-1930s has never beencapturedmore fully. Excellent film-making. 5 stars out of 5.

The is noexplanation for him not getting the Oscar for the Truman Show, there isno excuse for not even nominating him for The Truman Show and Man onthe Moon. I like the academy Awards, most of the time it is a fairthing, but in that year it was a disaster. How else can you explainthat in the year of Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line and ofcourse The Truman Show the most boring and joyless film of all timeShakespeare in Love gets eight, I repeat, eight Oscars and the TrumanShow gets none? I think it is because Jim has made so much Comedy,nobody really knows what tough work comedy means. It is ashaming thatthe Academy is sometimes still driven by outdated prejudices. For me,Jim Carrey is the greatest and most versatile actor in the world! AndThe Truman Show is The greatest performance by an actor I have everseen on screen. Finished!I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, ""No, it's not acomedy, well...not exactly.""  I didn't quite understand until I watched itmyself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comediesI've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  issubtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the directorissmashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated hisartistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well.The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING atthe Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performancewasn't ribald for once.The final scene--I willnot reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectualmovie.Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are thesameviewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presentedhere.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlyingmessage here, of course you won't like it!Although it sometimes seems that Hollywood is catering to the lowest common denominator of everything, The Truman Show is proof that there are great ideas that are able to be turned into great movies.  Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by.  The film's surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today's society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?  Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the ""real world"" in the credits, but in ""Christof's World.""  His high-profile media-drivenlife is no different from Truman's!"	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

What is mostremarkable today about this film is the way Allen presents it.  It's a movieabout a relationship.  But rather than taking a linear approach, Allen playswith time.  We see the middle, the begining, and the end. And not always inthat order.  Allen also breaks the fourth wall a lot and has many dreamsequences and asides which add to the complexity of the characters.  This isa highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie isnot about romance in the way that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is.  Rather,""Annie Hall"" is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny andheartbreaking and always classic.  ""Love fades,"" indeed.Annie Hall is a movie about life.  In recent films, there are fairlypredictable endings.  (i.e. guy gets girl after chase scene in Manhattan). Annie Hall goes against the grain of movies.  There is definite chemistrybetween Allen and Keaton.  That is one of the main reasons this movie issuccessful.  Alvy and Annie do not have high wage jobs, they do not goclubbing, nor are they incredibly attractive.  Why does a movie characterrelationship have to be so extreme it's unconvincing?  These days movieproducers create plots that are unbelievable.  They don't have any depth andusually have shallow intentions.  You can sense that the two leads care foreach other.  The situations in this movie resemble real life and that is whyit is so critically acclaimed and remembered. Sure Woody talked into thecamera, but that, in a sense is real life as well.  It reminds me of myusual thought process and how when I think; I feel as though I'm presentingmy thoughts to myself.  Only he is, presenting it to us.   This movie isclever and thought provoking.  If you're looking for the opposite of ayearly run of the mill movie, this is for you.  ""Annie Hall"" is a brilliant romantic comedy that could have only been madeby Woody Allen (Oscar-winning in directing and writing, nominated inacting). Allen stars as a Jewish stand-up comic who falls in love withaspiring actress Diane Keaton (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn as thetitled character). Their relationship is explored throughout the course ofthe film in a gentle and warm-hearted way. Allen's unique views and brand ofhumor are prevalent from start to finish and the film is clearly made in the1970s as many issues from that time period are explored as the filmprogresses. ""Annie Hall"" is simple in many ways, but deals with romanticissues in complex ways and the film is just so intelligent that it is nearimpossible to dislike. Woody Allen is brilliant as he usually is. DianeKeaton hit super-stardom as well with her role. The supporting cast includesthe likes of Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Tony Roberts, Christopher Walkenand Colleen Dewhurst. Look for an unknown Jeff Goldblum as an extra duringthe Los Angeles sequence. 5 stars out of 5."	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira.Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peaceand harmony. A rabbit named Judy Hops dreams of becoming the firstrabbit cop ever and on her journey to her dream she runs into a fox,named Nick Wilde. Together they will try to solve a mystery about somemissing predator civilians on the city of Zootopia. I personally lovedthis film and its message with all my heart. I was in tears by the endof the film just because of how beautiful/creative and well done themessage about living in peace and together even though we may bedifferent in race and/or other things (e.g. religion, gender etc). Theanimation is incredible to look at, this movie is an undeniable visualtreat every second of it. It is also very funny and references a lot ofother famous movies and TV Shows (Breaking Bad). Kids will have a goodtime marveling at the beautiful animation and the really likablecharacters, but I feel like adults will be the ones to enjoy this moviethe most. The message that comes across is timeless and very muchnecessary at this point and time. All the voice work is amazing,Ginnifer Goodwin does a fantastic job on the lead role and JasonBateman delivered that slick fun tone throughout his likable character.The music is composed by the talented Michael Giacchino, who has beenvery busy recently composing pretty much every amazing soundtrack on alot of successful movies. He also does a very good job here, with hiscomposition that delivers what is required on certain scenes. This isone fast paced, interesting, funny and feel good animated film thatDisney seems to have become masters at making recently. I did not findanything wrong with it all throughout the film, and it is definitelyone of my favorite films of 2016 so far.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

I've have neverseen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion andtransfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime thatneither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major actingawards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweepevery major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't getany recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of hiswonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the sametime), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that thecouple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, neveraddressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see ageniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and thedialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from thosetop ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether itwas serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, themovie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily beenremoved without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways.Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s,your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This isreal romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to beprovoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide.Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto themovies......   This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Say Anything"" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. This movie is mostly all dialogue-based. But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.""Before Sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters andtheir ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in themovie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in themiddle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in onlyone night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first nightin Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two charactersis much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic.Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never getsboring.The ending is genuinely sad without being ""Titanic"" or something. Even ifyou don't like love stories you should watch this film!I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released insummer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but itsconcept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a Europeanwoman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night togethertalking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be thisgreat. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the mostromantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked thecynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much aboutit, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plentyof thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort oflike My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's notJUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. SEEIT!                 It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels andfound this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who becomeattracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to eachother.   Ethan Hawke (Jesse) ""Tape"" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) ""ER"" 94 TVSeries (Nicole).  This gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul andmake you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wishyou had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down lovedand lost track of over the years.  Jesse and Celine have great conversation,and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two ofthem.  I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if youhave viewed this film, you will feel the same way.If you are a traveller, if there is a fire burning into your heart, ifyou'dcall ""home"" every place on earth, but none of them can give youenough, if you are always looking for the next thing and if youbelieve the other part of your soul is somewhere out there, see thismovie and you'll find out a little, but wonderful, piece of life sittingnext to you."	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I think it's one of the best epics of all time.It masterfully tells one of the most important stories of the 20th century,that of India's struggle to free itself, spearheaded by one of the mostextraordinary men of all time, Mahatma Gandhi. I would be hard pressed toname anything lacking about it. Direction, cinematography, costumes,they'reall great. And Ben Kingsley! Without a doubt his portrayal of Gandhi is oneof the best performances of his career, if not THE best. Playing thepacifist Indian lawyer-turned-leader couldn't have been an easy task, and Idon't think anyone could have pulled it off as well as he did. This moviedeserves all the praise anyone gives it and more. Excellent.The life of the legendary man from India (dominant Oscar-winner BenKingsley, who was a total unknown theatrical newcomer at the time) whogave up work as an attorney to defy British rule throughout the firsthalf of the 20th Century before falling to an assassin's bullet in1948. Long, opulent, breath-taking and completely memorable take on oneof the most important historical figures the world has ever known.Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough obviously studied DavidLean's epic film-making masterpieces from the 1950s and 1960s as wehave similarities galore with ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and muchmore importantly ""Lawrence of Arabia"". An all-star cast of veryold-time Hollywood legends (John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, John Mills)and relative newcomers who were on the rise (Candice Bergen, MartinSheen, Edward Fox, Nigel Hawthorne and a super quick glance of a veryyoung Daniel Day-Lewis) blend in a desert landscape of cinematicbrilliance. Make no mistake of it though, ""Gandhi"" works because ofKingsley as he weaves a colorful tapestry of cinematic performingungodliness with a totally convincing take on his role and the complexsubject matter. Running nearly 190 minutes, ""Gandhi"" still just usesflash-points to under-score the importance and significance of themajor topics within. Those familiar with advanced world history willlikely get more out of the film, but still a movie whose glittercontinues to shine as bright as ever. 5 stars out of 5."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Rent something else if youhave the attention span of a goldfish.Brilliant. 10/10This is not a legend : after reading Pierre Boileau's novel,Alfred Hitchcock phone the editor in the morning to buythestory for making a film. But another great master, Henri-GeorgesClouzot, had phone 30 minutes earlier. Mister Hitchcockwasangry! But Hitch couldn't have done better than Clouzot.This is P-E-R-F-E-C-T!

Well, I recentlybought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knewthatit was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best moviesever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It's amovieabout the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to ""go thedistance.""  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and adebt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with ashy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomesfriends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky's life really isn'tanything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion ApolloCreed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An oldboxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky'smanager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some ofthe greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky strivingto go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closingmoments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectlydemonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody.Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic andunforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably BurgessMeredith and Sylvester Stallone.   out of     As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about adown on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at theheavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, andthe champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romancebetween Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life asRocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is otherdown and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rockygets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.

Most people willprobably not understand the movie the first time they watch it, becausethey don't know what to watch for, but the 2nd time you watch the moviemost will consider it a great and profound movie. Another way tounderstand Donnie Darko is to have someone that has already seen themovie to watch it with you and tell you which parts of the movie toremember towards the end of the movie. This is not a movie to watch ifone does not like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is also not amovie for the lazy movie watcher to watch. I normally like the easybrained movies that require no thought-process but this is one thoughtprovoking movie that I give a 10 out of 10.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The other user commentshere (as well as many professional reviews) show how difficult it is todiscuss this film briefly, so I don't think I'm going to try.  I would onlysay that, like other films that push at the boundaries of cinematicgreatness--`Citizen Kane,' `Nashville,' and `Brazil' are three others thatcome to mind--it isn't really possible to place `8 ½' in any simplecategory.  It is a comedy and a tragedy, a satire and a celebration, a movieabout love and about the lack of it, a movie about making art and a movieabout living, an autobiography and the most challenging kind of fiction, amasterpiece of style and a movie that's really about something.  It's notfor everyone, but it should be, and it's quite possibly the single greatestmovie I have ever seen.  11 out of 10.Our tale begins on a congested road. Our Protagonist's car fills withgas. He desperately tries to escape. The camera gives us aclaustrophobic sense and within the first few minutes I am on the edgeof my seat. Needless to say our protagonist survives but the outcome ofthis scene reveals so much. Fellini's 8 1/2 is a brilliantly executedtale of a mans life crashing down around him. It is a semiautobiographical tale, Guido is a director who is in a bit of acreative slump. He is giving both the press and executives the runaround in order to buy time--hoping to find inspiration. His marriageis shaky and his relationship with his mistress is complicated. Guidotries to escape by going to a spa but his escape is not so easy... Thisfilm portrays inner conflict through dream sequences and fantasies asopposed to Expressionism. It is these sequences that enlighten theviewer and add dimension to the tale. To me 8 1/2 is the greatest filmin ever, eclipsing Citizen Kane (of course AFI's top 100 list islimited to American movies...) and proving to be enjoyable andinsightful.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Personal Note: For me, a mystery aboutthis film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of thegrandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing wassimilar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitelydifferent actors."	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thelavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help tocreate a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviouslyfilmed on a soundstage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largelyin part to the meticulous backdrop paintings used to add depth to theforeground. The musical numbers are quite lively & catchy -- neverslowing the pace of the film -- except perhaps for the Lion singing""King of the Jungle"". Judy Garland truly shines in her portrayal ofDorothy, perfectly capturing the wide-eyed innocence of her character.She definitely deserved the special Oscar she was awarded for herperformance. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, RayBolger as the Scarecrow, and Frank Morgan as the Wizard also turn inpraiseworthy characterizations. Definitely timeless in every sense ofthe word, this film is recommended to those of all ages  a 10/10!"	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimesironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. ""Twelvemonkeys"" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from thekind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded andhopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from afearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in ""Die hard""). No matterhow he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a verythrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movieis also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the onesthat could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that cancreate illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will beestimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties. Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's shortfilm LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches yourheart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagoricalworks with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head asmuch as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like-- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future wholiterally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientistskeeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, thejustifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaningpsychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even PaulBuckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's adon't-miss!I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorialcareer for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves mecold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that Iwould rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairlyunderrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come torealize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is evenbetter than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't comeup with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director forhire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is firstrate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach onto the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as hesometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large asyou would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb.Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite asurprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer,and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault thismovie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highlyrecommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film whichinspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant."	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

This may be his best role todate. From the trailers you know that his character will be out forblood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feelhis pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation.The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the filmemotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its drearysetting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative.This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must seefor most viewers.Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadiandirector Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbindingand disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frameand does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. AaronGuzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller,bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, posesserious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate castdoing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano,Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners isnot for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at nextyear's Oscars.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Steven Spielberg had made himself the mostsuccessful director of all time when he went all out with this one!Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on werejust a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for thefirst time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. Iwas highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dipperssuffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the mosthorrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now!Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for alot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attemptto bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to theeyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of thekiller shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more thanscary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to beAmitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swayingcurrents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach getangry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild,absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar forit! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths ofthe uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense,however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will hauntthose who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the storyis more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused onunderstanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do isplunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster ofthe sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and whynot? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark mustsurvive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, butalso the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not bigenough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience overand over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all!Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instantclassic!""Jaws"" is a thrill-ride of suspense that continues to deliver the goods tothe audience 25 years later.  The plot is somewhat thin: a large shark isterrorizing the tourists at the local beach.  However, with that said StevenSpielberg's direction is amazing.  The young director (only 28 at the time)showed unlimited potential that would only increase with age.  A greataccomplishment that could have been a multi-million dollar bust.  5 starsout of 5.

However,as stated by the review from a Hong Kong viewer, there is also depthand subtlety rarely found in action/thrillers. It is this depth thatmakes this movie brilliant. The depth of this movie is best served bythe understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters.Viewers are allowed into the inner changes of these characters andbefore long, the viewers begin to care about them, be it the ""good guy""(Yan) or the ""bad guy"" (Ming). The rest of cast successfully relate thecomplicated and exciting plot to the viewers, and all the supportingperformances are almost flawless, perhaps with the exception of thefemale psychologist who seems sadly one-dimensional. I grew up in HongKong but has since lived most of my life in Canada. With thisduo-cultural background, I have mixed feelings about the Hollywoodremaking of this movie. On the one hand, I am happy for the Hollywoodrecognition of this great movie by remaking it. On the other hand, Iwould hate to see how badly sabotaged the end result would be. Somethings just do not translate. As a minimum, I hope the great directorScorcese will make good use of the major plot line and generate a hautethriller and with the excellent cast, develop some in-depthcharacterization. The Chinese philosophy and the spirit of the originalfilm is better left undisturbed.A deceptively simple idea lies at the heart of this complex thriller:the Hong Kong police and a triad gang both have an informer in eachother's organisation: whoever's man picks the enemies' spy first winsthe game for his side. Add to that the customarydouble-agent-doesn't-know-which-side-he-is-on-anymore subplot (doubled,of course), and you have plenty of ingredients for a plot, althoughit's to the movie's credit that although a little stylised, it neverseems false or contrived. Fast-paced and bold, with a generous score,it never insults the viewer's intelligence either, and features justthe right level of moral ambiguity. At one level, it's just anotherthriller, and there's little in the way of wider political or socialsubtext; but on the other hand, it's a textbook lesson in the art ofmaking this sort of film."	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I always love it. It's touching, hasgreat music, scope and complexity. The film is alive in its humandetails. But what especially stood out to me this time was how amazingDana Andrew's performance is. His wife has cheated on him, he'ssuffering post-war trauma, and can't find a job--but he's stillcharming and funny. Even though his opinion of himself is pretty low,he keeps going ahead. I love how self-denigrating the character is, howhe suspects he's pretty worthless, while his parents, friends and Peggy(but not his wife) see him as extraordinary. And Andrews does it allwhile being understated and real. Yeah, Dana!Very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from theusers of IMDB.  The Best Years of Their Lives remains the finestcinematicstatement about veterans returning from war that I have come across.Easilythe finest performance by the often overlooked Frederick March.  In facttheentire cast shines, including music legend Hoagy Carmichael who treats usall with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River.   I would recommendthis excellent film to anyone who loves movies.  Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almostbecomes difficult. This movie tells several stories so well simultaneouslythat it was the first few times a movie I could not watch to completion. Itwas too real....and the characters SO STRONG that watching it became apersonal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families deal with theirhardships, one in particular, often hit me too hard. Now, I have watched inits entirety without interruption several times, and I realize what I alwayssuspected. This movie is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the blending ofseveral stories without being even the least bit choppy, everything aboutthis movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder, it certainlymust have deserved them.	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Little argumentwill be made against John Alcott's Academy Award-winning cinematography orKen Adam's production design, however, and Kubrickian motifs are manifest inthe gallery of characters' wide-ranging displays of cowardice, guile,duplicity, avarice, jealousy, greed, and cruelty.  Marisa Berenson isterribly short-changed in her role as the Lady Lyndon, but a number of otherperformers are given the opportunity to create a handful of memorablemoments -- especially Arthur O'Sullivan (albeit briefly) as the charming,intelligent highwayman and Patrick Magee as the Chevalier.  Love it or hateit, Barry Lyndon will remain essential viewing for aficionados of thedirector, who enjoys taking his usual shots at the more discouraging aspectsof human behavior.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

A few things stand out and of course the performances areterrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince peoplethat he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watchhis character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBIagent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League ofTheir Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a greatfilm star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in hisalready interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son inthe restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken.You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveysthese emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rootingfor him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is thebeautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with acamera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particularstands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window onWalken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film itsvery personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale characterbecause as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to besomeone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that heworked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French policeofficer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seemto forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family andthe aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a verygood one. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002)  Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, ChristopherWalken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Frank JohnHughes, Brian Howe, John Finn, Jennifer Garner.  DiCaprio gives a grandlycharming performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. a teenager who adopted theprofessional guises of airplane pilot, physician and lawyer to front hischeck kiting schematic modus operandi during the 1960s and eventually makingthe FBI's most wanted list by bilking millions until his capture andimprisonment.  Based on Abagnale's best-selling memoir and adapted with leanstorytelling by Jeff Nathanson, the film never lets up in the giddycat-and-mouse/Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote relationship between fugitiveDiCaprio and amalgamated FBI square Hanks (replete with thick as clamchowder Boston accent, dorky specs and porkpie hat) one step behind histwo-steps ahead prey and a unique dynamic of a father/son esthetic.  Walkengives an Oscar worthy supporting turn as the elder Abagnale whose financialwoes and tanglement with the IRS acts as his son's catalyst.  Once againfilmmaker Steven Spielberg makes popular entertainment into a work of art."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

His co-star in here, Farley Granger, is okay but is no match for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man gets in trouble, etc. Unlike a lot of his other films, I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies.Hitchcock's real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films, even comedies such as ""Throw Momma Off The Train.""Robert Walker admirably goes all out as a psychotic daddy-hater whobefriends tennis pro Farley Granger and discovers the rather naiveyoung man hates his estranged wife; Walker suggests swapping murders.Lots of intricate plotting in the set-up, but this Alfred Hitchcockthriller is relieved of tension by its banalities, such as the vapiddialogue, an overlong tennis sequence near the finale, and sillysituations like the one where Walker ""cleverly"" winds up in hisfather's bed when Granger arrives. The frenzied finale plays well, butwith some afterthought you may notice how emotionally hollow it is,what with an innocent, elderly carnival worker getting shot dead by thepolice (!) and nobody seems to care. Flamboyant, if over-the-top,performances, a great deal of style in the usual Alfred Hitchcockfashion, but not much substance. 1/2 from "	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Few comic book movies have ever looked good onscreen. The X-Men and Spider Man movies have done a good job breakingthat stigma. In my opinion the aforementioned flicks have been aperfect melding of Hollywood and the Comic book universe, but ""SinCity"" elevates it to an art form, literally. It is hands down, the bestrepresentation of a comic book turned film ever. After catching thetrailer on a TV commercial, I was intrigued, to say the least. So Iwent to my local comic book store and bought the Frank Miller books themovie is based on, and enjoyed them for their off beat humor,incredible violence, and stories of love, lust, friendship, honor andseedily-earned redemption in the underworld of fictional Basin City.Upon further contact with the Comic Book store owner, he clued me in tothe sneak preview on the 16th of March (yesterday as I post this), solike a kid on his way to pick up the latest issues of whatever comicsare popular these days, I took the day off and went to the showing.Having recently read the stories that are included in the film (""SinCity,"" later renamed to ""The Hard Goodbye""; ""The Big Fat Kill;"" and""That Yellow Bastard""), I was amazed at how much of the dialogue andnarration of the books actually made it to the big screen translation.This coming from a guy whose heart was ripped out by the bastardizationof ""The Sum of All Fears,"" bear in mind - I know what it's like to havea book you love not be given the loving attention we feel it deserveswhen it hits the big screen. The dialogue isn't always the best (it's acomic book, not Shakespeare, people) and even the best acting in theworld won't change that. But seriously, if you're paying attention tothat minor blemish, you're missing the point of the movie to beginwith. Aside from the dialogue, the imagery in the film is something tobe appreciated, whether you like the stories or not. Equally beautifuland gritty black and white, with occasional brushes of color that allbut explode off the screen- the comic books (graphic novels to youpurists) act like storyboards for this movie- as life is breathed intothe still images on the pages. The ""From Book to Screen"" section thatis no doubt going to be a feature on the future DVD release of thismovie will no doubt drop a few jaws for those that haven't bothered tocheck out the source material. Cold, cruel humor and over-the-top,audience-wince-inducing violence are blended in the style of ""PulpFiction"" and ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" for obvious reasons, but as Istated before, it's all direct from the books. Kudos to RobertRodriguez for not compromising in the making of this film and for hiscommitment to the original source material; and also to his co-directorFrank Miller for his obvious contributions. And to the actors in it-the cavalcade of them. My favorite performance was turned in by MickeyRourke for playing Marv absolutely letter perfect from the book (and hedemonstrates one of the best narrative voices I've heard in a moviesince Morgan Freeman in ""The Shawshank Redemption""). Elijah Wood has anon-speaking role, but his Kevin will follow you home as much as NickStahl's Junior does. Clive Owen is solid as Dwight (and I know a lot ofgeek fan-boys out there were upset that he was picked for thecharacter) and Bruce Willis does what he does best as a cop that won'tquit, Hartigan. The standout female performance is a toss up betweeneither Rosario Dawson for her valkyrie, warrior, hooker Gail, or (itkills me to say it) Brittany Murphy as a ""His Girl Friday"" cocktailwaitress. The movie is definitely not for all tastes, and kidsshouldn't be allowed in buildings even next to theaters showing thismovie- but it will no doubt be a hotly discussed film as we creepthrough Hollywood's typically ""phoned-in, pre-Summer"" Feb/March/Aprilofferings.If I was to use one word to describe this film it would have to be....Violent! if i was allowed two words I would add 'Visceral'.The movie is two hours long and is structured in a similar way to Pulp Fiction. A bunch of stories set in a consistent world, with characters falling in and out of each others plot lines. On the whole it works brilliantly, and for the duration there isn't a boring moment. It is High octane, million miles and hour storytelling, and it EASILY Robert Rodriguez's best film.Allowing Frank Miller to write the script was a fantastic move, as the dialogue is edgy, witty and VERY faithful to the original material. In fact, many many lines are just taken straight from the pages. likewise, the camera behaves like a moving cartoon box out. The framing of all the key scenes is SO faithful to the printed page that it produces a truly original look that is fairly incomparable. Visually its a true original. Sometimes these visuals fall down, there are some very very obvious digital shots that don't quite gel, but on the whole the cinematography is jaw dropping. You could literally pause the movie at almost any point and just hang that frame on a wall, its that beautiful.Performances are good all round. Mickey Rourke absolutely nails Marv, and the girls of Old Town are all as beautiful as they are deadly. The other standout for me was Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling. Bruce Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan.The film isn't entirely void of criticism. there's some fudging of time lines with Hartigans character (do we really buy Bruce Willis as a nearly 70 year old man?) and the jumps from story to story are jarring initially, but once it settles into itself the ride is fantastic.My other main criticism is the same I have with Quentin Tarantinos work. That every character and every voice in the movie is the same. This is more a fault of the source material, but when every single person is a wise cracking, hard boiled tough guy (even the women) then it kind of distills the effect of their toughness. In a film that is predominantly voice over driven, it is hard to differentiate characters when they all sound exactly the same, both tonally, and in the language they use. Even Marv, who's supposed to be a meat head, talks in gravelly prose that would make Bukowski feel like a Nancy.Other Minor niggles are hardly worth mentioning. From a technical standpoint the sound effects are WAY to loud. All of the punches, gunshots etc are given such ridiculous prominence on the track that they threaten to make mockery of the violence. I actually found that i didn't want any more guns fired cos it was hurting my ears! all in all though, its one hell of a ride, and only a couple of notches below Pulp Fiction on the 'Oh my god that film was cool-o-meter'.Channel surfing late one night I stumbled across this film and stoppedto look because of the unusual cinematography. It's visually stunning,mostly in b&w and that evokes a film noir atmosphere punctuated withthose brilliant flashes of color. Two minutes later I couldn't take myeyes away. This unique film is superbly executed, the casting, thescreenplay, the special effects, everything about it. As we all know,there is an expansive library of film work out there for a wide rangeof tastes and sensibilities. If yours are delicate, if you are offendedby gore and violence, then this film will NOT be your cup of tea. Stayaway from it. But if both the horror and film noir genres appeal toyou, you'll probably find this movie as captivating as I did.I just came back from an advance screening of Sin City, and I can tellyou this is one salient reel of pitch of a film. Think of it as filmnoir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most ofFrank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment,but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crimewriters of the '40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B&W withdigitally-hued Technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off thescreen. This film was tailor made for most of the people who have beenfollowing Miller's writing for the past twenty odd years, brimming withmany of his trademark elements and visual style that he, along withMessrs. Rodriguez and Tarantino, capture brilliantly. Not for moresensitive or under aged souls, Sin City will burn like a fire that youhave to watch for everyone else."	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

""The Battle ofAlgiers"" provides many answers to that enigmatic title. It does notattemptto show us the entire war but centers on the city of Algiers. Even thoughyou are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is attimes hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and oftenunsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co productionbetween Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turnitself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort ofneutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled fromindividualdemonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officerswhofought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of theirformer enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that wouldkill their own people. The camera shows no heros or villains but humanityinits darkest forms. This is a powerful film with superb direction andcinematography. It truly is one of a kind and once seen will never beforgotten.I wish I could locate a videocassette of this film--subtitled, not dubbed.The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was apompous disclaimer that ""not one foot"" of documentary footage had been used.But, in light of the finished product, it's a remarkable statement. If afilm has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitablepart of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to itscredit that one never gets a sense of ""good guys vs. bad guys"" here--only ofpeople trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which noescape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing tosee this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the""heroic"" Algerian revolutionaries while booing the ""villainous"" French, inview of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint.This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, andbeautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven't seenit and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--andpray that it's subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as isusually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece.Capturing a historic incident/moment with extraordinary accuracy makes afilm truly beautiful, painful, and masterful. With the tradition ofItalianNeo Realism and French New Wave - i.e. shooting in location and castingnonprofessional actors, The Battle of Algiers harshly seals the uglyrealities of both French Legion and Algerian Guerillas - i.e.indiscriminatebombs, tortures, and scapegoats. Ennio Morricone composed one of his earlysuccessful scores."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first thing that a discerningeye would notice throughout the film is the undying uniqueness ofPacino's originality. This was just another movie destined toreassuring viewers of Al's status of an icon. The movie itself isendearing and entertaining. Though the movie is supposed to appear likea bank robbing, and in a sense it is, but deep in the heart robbing issimply a way to achieve a totally different goal, of course other thanmoney! It is about affection and mutual caring. It's about whatsituations a person is ready to embark into in order to show how muchhe cares for another one. And I guess this is the point of the wholemovie, which is stylistically decorated with dozes of sarcasm andpleasantry with sporadic undertones of bravery. The characters are allinnocent which innocence seems to relate them to each other. What Ideem as very courageous here are the thematic elements, homosexuality.I guess the time when the movie was made the society had still beenruled by prejudiced mentalities that could really ruin this innocuouspiece of art. For this, I praise the very daring Sidney Lumet, one ofmy favorite directors. 10/10I've seen this movie and for me it's Al Pacino at his best! The moviehas a very simple premise, two guys rob a bank, but everything that cango wrong does. In the beginning the women who work in the bank areafraid, but once the situation escalates into a sideshow, some thewomen become comfortable with the situation. Basically, the entiremovie is in the bank and all types of comedy and drama surrounds it.This is Al Pacino early in his career and for anyone who hasn't seenthe movie, I definitely recommend it. Just keep in mind between all themadness you see in the film that this is a true story, and veryentertaining!	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

What canone say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable,impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterlyremorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing anentire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit thefamily fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care inpreserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives hemust eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; andthere's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to hissocial ""superior."" The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour,is a shining example of ""British humour"" at its best. It is subtle,clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliantentertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much betterthan this.As is the case with most great things, the basic premise of this filmis simple. There is, however, an essential darkness at the heart of themovie: the cold blooded and calculating murder of all those who standbetween Dennis Price and his possible succession to a title. That thisis treated in so light and civilised a way is the triumph of the film.The screenplay and performances complement each other perfectly and area credit to all those involved. I cannot think of a weak link in thefilm. The casting was beautifully judged down to the most minorcharacter. The leads are, though, just about perfect. For my money, itis the best of Dennis Price's film work (though his Jeeves ontelevision in the 60's was good, too). Guinness was splendid and wellsupported by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood. I have probably seenthe film more than a dozen times in the past thirty years. Each time itoffers something fresh and new. Quite simply one of the best.I've seen this gem half a dozen times and look forward to seeing it a fewtimes more. It's a masterpiece of unsentimental, yet genteel, humor, andfeatures performances by some extraordinary actors. Sir Alec Guiness's eightdifferent turns have been much commented on and deserve every superlativethey've received. Dennis Price is too little recognized--in the US, atleast--for his gifts, as his work here proves. Valerie Hobson is wonderful,and Joyce Greenwood is...I would happily buy a recording of her reading theOED, just to hear that astonishing voice. And, in a small but marvelousrole, Miles Malleson is superb. If you have not seen this film, it's readilyavailable. Give yourself a treat. I know that Hollywood seems to haveforgotten that there's nothing to be gained by trying to remake a perfectfilm. If they ever dare to do it with this one--I don't give a damn who isin it, or who directs or writes--don't bother. See the original. Nonegenuine without the Ealing Label. ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is really an essay in acting from one ofBritain's greatest, Sir Alec Guinness, and what better way to remember himthan the film which gave him eight roles to play? True, one or two arebarely given time to register before Dennis Price dispatches them (LadyAgatha would have been interesting as a fully rounded character), but thosewhich are developed - Henry, the photography enthusiast in particular, arecleverly played and memorable.  Price also does well in his role.  Theladies - Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson - are excellent.  The greatstrength of this film is in its black humour, and of course in its delicioustwist ending.  I can't bear to think of it remade with a 2000'sgloss."	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But such was the level of anticipation with""gangs of wasseypur"" that I found myself standing in front of theticket counter at quarter to nine. The movie, which is 160 minuteslong, starts with a shoot-them-up which may be the most authenticshoot-to-kill scene in Hindi cinema. The movie tells the story ofrivalries between different sects of Muslims: the butchers, Qureshis,and the Pathans, Khans and extend over a period of three generations.The story starts from the pre- independence era when the British ownedthe mines in Dhanbad. After independence, these mines pass on to thewealthy landlord who hires an exiled Pathan to act as his strongman.The pathan, the father of Sardar Khan (Manoj Vajpayee) has been kickedout of his village, Wasseypur, after a confrontation with the localmusclemen, the Qureshis, and is now forced to work in the mines ofDhanbad. He starts becoming too big for his shoes and is bumped off bythe landlord thus beginning a series of killings and counter-killings.The acting by the ""star"" cast is stunning with Manoj Vajpayee leadingthe pack in as good as a performance as ""Bheeku Mahatre"" in Satya. Whenhe stares lustfully at the back side of Reema Sen (here resurrectedafter being in the wilderness for nearly half a dozen years), you canfeel the lust as a physical thing. He is backed by a very strongensemble cast. The real strength of the movie is its dialogues. Thewords, replete with the choicest of abuses, feel as if they werewiretapped. The conversation rings true to life and had me laughing atthe sheer vulgarity of it. The patois is captured very faithfully. Theonly negative point about the movie is its length which could have beenedited somewhat in the second half when the third generation takes up(like the long Godfather III, if you may). Anurag Kashyap has put hissoul into the movie and that is visible from every frame of the movie.The direction is the best I have seen this year in Hindi cinema andwill only increase the expectations from the second part of this opus.And that is why I am jealous of the lucky bastards at the Cannes filmfestival who got to see both the parts back to back. The movie ends ata tantalizing junction and the prospect of meeting with these barelylovable characters for a second outing left me salivating.Gangs of Wasseypur stands firmly on the grounds of direction, acting,screenplay, story-line, cinematography & music. Manoj Pandey hasdelivered an outstanding performance. The movie has to be rated ""A""because of a lot of abuses (which implies, its not a family flick). Butthe essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done asplendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The mostimportant aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of newfaces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew onboard when actors like Piyush Mishra & Yashpal Sharma are totallywasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt thatAnurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch.Just watched this movie today on the day of release.Excellentbackground music throughout the movie. Excellent acting by ManojBajpayee & Richa Chaddha. Superb comedy and action. A movie you need towatch in theaters to enjoy it fully.Dabangg is nothing in front of thismovie.This movie is just Entertainment,Entertainment andEntertainment.Had to choose between Teri Meri Kahani & Gangs ofWasseypur today. I am glad that we chose to go for Gangs ofWasseypur.It takes a lot of skill to make a movie like this. I hope itsweeps all the awards this year. Manoj Bajpayee's role as Bhikoo Mhatrewas memorable and in this movie his role as Sardar Khan will be morememorable than any of his past performances.One of the most awaited movies of the year, the first part of Gangs ofWasseypur lives up to expectations. However, the only disappointingaspect of the movie is that one has to wait for the part two of themovie to see how the story unfolds. The movie is based at Wasseypur andother surrounding areas of Dhanbad. The time-line of the movie spansfrom early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie isexpected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of PathansShahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (ManojBajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local donRamadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle betweenPathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan onone side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are thehighlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets ofcoal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love storiestoo. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cusswords one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. Themusic of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the filmto fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must-watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great actingfrom all the actors."	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The script is one of the main stars of the filmitself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa'smouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action filmsyou'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, thismovie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightenedby the skeleton scenes). 10/10	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

We had never seen most of the actors which wasrefreshing and the acting by the entire cast made it easy to gettotally involved. I laughed out loud and shed quite a few tears in TheHelp, and will remember it and recommend it to my friends. It waswonderful to see so many scenes in which the actors related to eachother so perfectly. Even the vilest characters showed moments ofconflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that hadlong been inbred in them. I am especially grateful to the team whoprovided a film that told an engaging story about human relationshipswith important lessons for my daughter. That is a rare occurrence intoday's movies.Lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merelypalatable but enjoyable. We know by now that the plight of the""colored"" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way orshape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal inthe wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mildmargins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forgetdocumentaries of the period or ""The Long Walk Home"" with WhoopiGoldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in ""The Help"" too and she'svery funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. Thebitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. EmmaStone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbinglyrecognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt thefilm was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's wereits weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it."	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Featuring an outstandingstarring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning andsupporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley,Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful andeminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respectingthe story it is based upon. The English-language debut of 'Headhunters'director Morten Tyldum, this British World War II thriller is a highlyconventional story about humanity that creates a fascinating character,anchored by a hypnotically complex performance.I'll make my review short. Go see this. It has all the elements of agreat movie from the acting to the score by Alexandre Desplat.Excellent script and delivery. It was well received at TIFF 14 where itwas named People's Choice. The cast members really gelled on screen. Itwas well edited because the pace of the movie did not lag at any time.When watching this you will quickly realize that these actors (BenedictCumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Allen Leech)will be around for a long time entertaining us. If you like A BeautifulMind or even Good Will Hunting, you will enjoy this. It comes out inNovember 2014. Don't miss it. This one is Oscar worthy.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Selkies,magical beings that change from seals to humans, have the power toreverse such changes. This is because selkies are in touch with nature,love and the ancient way of things. However, selkies cannot make thechanges by themselves. They need help from humans. A little girl,Saoirse, is a selkie. Saoirse attempts to keep her family from turningto stone. Her family is prone to grief and selfishness. They do notreveal their hearts to others. Saoirse's task becomes all the moredifficult when her mother, also a selkie, strangely disappears in thenight. And through no fault of her own, Saoirse's voice vanishes aswell. On top of this, strangers who already lost their emotions forgood, try to make Saoirse lose hope. Will her father, older brother andgrandmother, all preoccupied with their own concerns, help or turnaway? The beautiful, spell binding and intricate animation of this filmincludes the Northern lights, sunrises and surreal underwater worlds.The singular theme of the film underscores the truth that stories,emotions, animals and nature connect us to our better selves and toeach other. From the director of the spectacular, award winning Secretof Kells. Seen at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.Amazing artwork and amazing story! I must say this movie has a story totell that will work up to your emotion just like sea touching a stoneand fills it with life. Music is great! The use of color andenvironment is so vivid and well thought. ""Song of the sea"" takes youinto a emotional and adventurous journey with Saoirse and Ben. Istrongly recommend to watch this animated movie. If you are a fan ofanimation you will simply love it. I've watched quite a lot of work ofStudio Ghibli. 2D work like this is rare to come by these days.Wonderful creation! You should make movies like this and unlock a partof us which has been lost in the waves of time. Thank you. :)Director Tomm Moore's followup to his Oscar nominated debut The Secret of Kells certainly has the potential to follow in its footsteps if it can reach enough of an audience. Song of the Sea adapts the Selkie legends and takes them one step further. I'm quite familiar with the story having spent the last year of my degree writing a short film about it, but Songsubverts the mythological and tells a sequel of sorts. The story is essentially Beauty and the Beastplus The Little Mermaid, wherein seals turn to women and fall in love with men on the land, staying with them until they are called back to the sea.Beginning at the end of the tale, the mother Selkie, who has wedded a human fisherman and already had a baby boy with him, is pregnant once more. About to give birth, she relents that she has to go back to sea and sacrifices herself to leave a baby girl to the remaining family. It jumps six years into the future. The older brother, Ben, resents his younger and mute sister, Saoirse, for their mother having to leave them for good. At odds between their home by the rough treacherous sea and their fussy Grandma who wants them to live in the city, they're forced away from their distraught father (voiced charmingly by Brendan Gleeson) and their dog to live with her.Immediately reluctant to settle, they begin their journey home and discover that the ancient stories and characters their mother told them are true. As a half-Selkie, Saoirse has the power to save a race of trolls turned to stone, and Ben has the responsibility of making sure she meets their goal. The theme is overt, bottling up emotions turns you to stone, but the truth in that is powerful. There's a very delicate storybook quality to the film. Perhaps mostly due to the simplistic and now refreshing 2D animation style that glitters beautifully with its swirls, but also in the episodic way the story unfolds. It is quite pedestrian in its traditions and obviously contrived in its storytelling, one ostensibly accessible for children, but the emotional honesty and depth of the characters make it engaging. It has at least a sprightly spirit of adventure.Granted, side characters are often eccentric for the sake of being eccentric. Though they do have the type of elasticity we haven't seen since the Disney films of the 60s and 70s after they've become more reserved in the 90s. The elegant style owes a debt to Ghibli films, but I'm not a big fan of Hayao Miyasaki outside of his craft and I preferred this more identifiable approach to the fantasy. Fortunately, among all the fantastical elements it has a very grounded sense of humour rather than an often irritatingly quirky one that a film like Frozen boasts and it makes it a much easier film to invest in. With its overwhelming ending, endearing characters, and lovely Celtic music, Song Of The Sea a thoroughly pleasant and poignant experience. The film won't be big enough to contend for the Oscar win, but with any luck we'll see it on the shortlist and in the top five.7/10"	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

This is just nothing but atypical Hollywood s. Matt did a poor performance as a character whois caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotionalbut instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on yourface like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-upartist or a sound engineer from the set of ""Big bang theory"" would havewritten better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of""WTF"" or ""Seriously?"" moments in this movie and I wonder what happenedto one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive highfive/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, baddrama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science,predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don'tbuy!I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekendand I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had tooffer. So just how bad was ""The Martian?"" So bad that after an hour Irealized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat thansitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog(lines like ""Fk you Mars!"" and ""I'm going to science the ST out ofit!"") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into thespace program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.)Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one ofthose guys on ""The Big Bang Theory?"" Snarky and idiotic and alwayscracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ whathe's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was withall the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far asI'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a videocamera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone whowould potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, thingslike: ""Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist."" It's clear he wasattempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginaryaudience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing thereis. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowlingballs of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you'vealready figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant thatthere was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instructionmanual for a microwave oven. ""How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there'ssome poo."" (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was asslack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, falsefalseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first houror so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feelmy brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self-preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't getme started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musicaltaste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.)If there is a more unoriginal, un-involving, unbelievable waste of timeout there, I haven't seen it. So of course: Line up the Oscars!I generally don't give out ten stars lightly when it comes to ratingfilms, but my God, 'The Martian' more than deserves this. The sciencefiction survival genre has become a big hit recently with 2013's'Gravity' and last years 'Interstellar', and now the Mars-set tale 'TheMartian'. From the hands of sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott, themastermind behind 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' comes the thrilling screenadaptation of Andy Weir's novel. Within the first few minutes, theaudience are already on the edge of their seats as Matt Damon fightsfor survival in an Oscar-worthy performance. Playing an astronautabandoned on the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead,Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment, supportedby some stunning cinematography and fantastic visual effects, 'TheMartian' is able to blend humour and emotion within it's dramatic plotof survival. Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Sean Bean,Chiwetel Ejiofor, just a few big names that support Damon wonderfully.If you are a fan of 'Interstellar' or any other science fictionsurvival tale or even some of Scott's previous sci-fi adventures, thenthis is one to definitely add to your watch list. Best viewed on thebig screen!This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon'sinherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this filmwere so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where nocharacter behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced anun-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fallover themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic isstereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And inwhat seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, avery transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Blackpeople are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever;the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed asexceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than themen. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white maleauthority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of whatan ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters.They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity,femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be lovedand celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interactionof those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one."	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes ofresearch you could have determined if this movie was for you or notWith that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting andwriting were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you areeasily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the moviefor you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for2 straight hours you will love this movie.So Deadpool , a character which was butchered in X-Men Origins but herehe is again taking the stage all by himself.Its so funny ,explicit,humorous and hit all the right chords of an R Rated Comedy about a herowho definitely kills more than villains. Firstly this movie worksbecause of the freedom it received and without any intervention fromanyone it does what it should do, it makes you laugh filled withwierdly funny jokes and amazing action sequences.And Ryan Reylonds isabsolutely amazingly fantastic. Where was he all those years ago? Hisportrayal deserves him an Oscar but academy.This film from stating thefilm's cast and title till the end credtis roll is a full on laughterride.I mean this is the film that makes fun of the x men timeline andstates that's confusing.This is the one that points out that theXavier's mansion blows up in every x men movie.I will not go further onthe story though since you should watch it and be surprised but I cantell you every thing u loved or hated about a superhero movie is beinglaughed at in this flick.go and watch"	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I can't think ofanother movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this onedoes. This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Goodvs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent ""peck"" on thecheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe best of all, you don't haveto be in Mensa to ""get it"" and enjoy the movie like you do with some ofMiyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies totake a break from thinking). This is just a flat-out enjoyable moviethat everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The onlysour note is the American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be just plainannoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on thetwo-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spokenJapanese? If you can read at a second-grade level then watch theoriginal Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won't regretit.Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as hisnewer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it beany better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which isreused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time iheard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response ofany movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totallyawesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on hisown! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won't give it away, but the end isreally great. I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaaand Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castlewhen it comes out (sometime next year i hope) If you like Miyazakicheck this one out as it readily available in the USA.

The series had ended and he was offered thisstrange new and challenging role in this movie of the American West that wasmade in Italy! Eastwood said his wife read that script and liked it. Shesaid it was really ""wild"" because it was written in Western ""slang"" byItalians who really didn't understand English. He did this picture almost asa lark, and then read that it had become one of the biggest hits in Europeand then when it was released in America it outgrossed even the most popularcurrent American films and made Clint Eastwood both a star and a phenomenon.Its strange to me that the best films ever made about the American westshould have been made by Sergio Leone, an Italian who couldn't even speakEnglish. Clint Eastwood said that all he knew in Italian was ""arrevadershi""and all Leone knew in English was ""goodbye"" and yet these two combined tomake an awesome film. As the poncho clad ""Man With No Name"", Eastwoodcreated a role that hit us like a punch in the face and really re-definedthe definition of the true Western hero. Eastwood tore out pages and pagesof the dialogue and reduced his character to the bare bones to make him moremysterious. Leone said that he clad Eastwood in that sweat stained serepe togive him a cloak of mystery and put the cheroot in his mouth as a pendantbetween his two cold eyes and it worked like a charm. He broke all the rulesand re-defined screen violence. I read that Leone wanted to make a blood andguts Western and show to the audience ""I want them to feel what the hell itis like to get shot"" and he does it! The scene where Clint is beaten to apulp is one of the most graphic that you will ever see. It would have killedmost other men!'A Fistful Of Dollars' is a wonderful movie which, despite having anenormous following of fans around the world, sometimes gets unfairlydismissed in my opinion. For two reasons - firstly because the second andthird movie in Leone/Eastwood ""Man With No Name"" trilogy ('For A Few DollarsMore' and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly') are so damn good it's easy tooverlook this one. Despite being made on a much tighter budget and beingless ambitious than the sequels to follow, it's still one of the greatestwesterns ever made in my opinion. The second reason is the Yojimbo thing.Now movie buffs frequently slam 'A Fistful Of Dollars' as being a rip off ofKurosawa's 'Yojimbo', which I think is extremely misleading. I'm notdisputing that Leone was familiar with Kurosawa (I have no idea one way orthe other), but one name I rarely hear ANYONE mention is Dashiel Hammett.Hammett's hard boiled crime classic 'Red Harvest' was published THIRTY YEARSbefore 'Yojimbo' and features the same central premise of an anti-heroplaying two rival groups off against each other. So if anyone deservesacknowledgement as uncredited inspiration for Leone (AND Kurosawa) it'sHammett. Anyway, this is an absolutely brilliant movie and it launched ClintEastwood, a popular TV actor, into being a major movie star, and likewiseput Sergio Leone on the map. I can't recommend 'A Fistful Of Dollars' highlyenough, it's pure entertainment, and very, very cool!The first of Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"" is now overshadowed by itssuperior successors, but remains an exciting introduction to this peculiargenre. Clint Eastwood redefined the notion of a hero in this film, a man whoseems to operate by a code but doesn't feel the need to explain it. Althoughthe U.S. advertising campaign billed Eastwood's character as ""The Man WithNo Name,"" a name is one thing he does have - Joe - but almost everythingelse about him is a mystery except for his deadly proficiency with a gun.Leone's style would be more pronounced in later films, but this one providedthe template. Eastwood is superb, of course, as is Gian Maria Volante(billed as Johnny Wells) as his deadly opponent, Ramon Rojo. If it's slowmoving at times, the music of Ennio Morricone always takes up the slack.A classic. The first, or one of the first, films to introduce the concept ofthe Western antihero. Sergio Leone pioneered a lot of things here. Thebrightness, the oppressive sunlight. The ugly brutality of Westerngunfights, that had always been cleaned up in Hollywood. I understand thatLeone's occasional framing of the shooter and his victims in the same shotwas not allowed at the time in American films. I thought, upon seeing thisfilm years ago, that some characters (Eastwood) spoke in English, and othercharacters in Italian. Who knows, maybe some spoke Spanish or German. Mustmake for an interesting acting job. I rarely notice a movie's music, but theoriginal score by Ennio Morricone was so fitting. Probably the best match offilm and music up to that time, and only bested by Hugh Montenegro(?) in""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". A very good movie.

The Princess awakensfrom her slumbers in this classic fall-from-innocence, coming-of-agetale with a royal twist. Audrey Hepburn stakes her claim as the mostperfect woman who ever lived. Gregory Peck at his best as thene'er-do-well American reporter who guides her chastely from girlhoodto womanhood. What can I add? One of the finest movies ever made. Nowwill you please stop reading this review and rent the movie, forheaven's sake? ...Now, according to the rules, this review has to gofor at least 10 lines. And yet I've said everything I have to say aboutRoman Holiday. It is perfect. Rent it. Or better yet, buy it. You won'tregret it. There, now that's 11 lines, that ought to do it.Audrey Hepburn doesn't have a vulgar bone in her body: she breezesthrough this comedic romp with the spirit of a saint on holiday. When aprincess escapes the castle while touring Italy, a down-on-his-luckAmerican reporter chances to meet her and smells a good story. A joyfulfairy tale, but with the heartbreak of reality at the finale, and whatsweet sadness there is in those final shots! Hepburn won an Oscar forBest Actress, and deserved it. Gregory Peck is almost playful in hisscenes with her, and Eddie Albert is a perfect buddy-match. DirectorWilliam Wyler sets up the story very gingerly, but he cuts loose aswell, and the whole picture plays like a delectable dessert. 1/2from I could just write my one line summary over and over again, but that wouldmake for a rather dull comment, so I won't (stop cheering in the balcony!).In addition to the wonderful Ms. Hepburn, Gregory Peck does his typicallysuperb job and Eddie Albert turns in a delightful (but no doubt painful,forhim) performance in this incredibly charming jewel of a film.  This filmmade me an incurable romantic for life!  sigh I'd better quit before myapartment becomes a wind-tunnel!  Joyously, happily recommended!	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
